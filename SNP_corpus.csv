The SNP Government are taking practical steps  such as supporting disabled and young people and their families from birth  through school and into the world of work. We are also investing £5.4 million over 2 years to improve learning disability services in Scotland.  However the UK Government’s harsh welfare reforms are having a disproportionately negative impact on disabled people here in Scotland. We have seen the criteria for disability benefits toughened  services cut and reforms which unfairly target disabled people. ,2015-12-03T18:02:57+0000,817,298

link,Jim Eadie explains why progressive policies in Scotland are putting the Scottish and UK governments streets apart on social housing:   Over the last five years 20 400 new housing association or council homes have been built in Scotland – that’s 400 more than the SNP target for the social rented sector. In turn this has contributed to the Scottish Government not only meeting its target of 30 000 new affordable homes but doing so ahead of schedule. Compare that record of delivery with what is happening in England where latest figures show that the number of new social sector homes has slumped to a record low.  But we know that there is much more still to do. That’s why if re-elected  the SNP will build on this success and invest at least £3 billion to deliver a further 50 000 affordable homes over the next five years.  The Scottish Government is not just investing in new social housing but is also protecting existing stock by abolishing Thatcher’s right to buy policy.  Meanwhile in England  the Tory government has accelerated the sale of council homes and is extending the scheme to housing association homes. The UK Government has also committed to building proportionately fewer new affordable homes than pledged by the SNP and has made no commitment to social housing. ,2015-12-07T13:18:34+0000,976,431

link,John Swinney indicates that there are tough choices ahead for Scotland in the wake of Tory Chancellor cuts:    On Wednesday I will set out the Scottish Government’s budget.  I will be doing so against the backdrop of yet more cuts to Scotland s budget by the Tory government. George Osborne is making these cuts out of choice  not necessity. And taken together with the cuts imposed since 2010  he plans to remove one in every eight pounds Scotland has to spend.  What s more  it s not just for one year. The Chancellor will impose real terms cuts on Scotland every year from now until 2020.  The SNP Government has consistently shown how a different approach could be taken. We’ve sent detailed recommendations to the UK Government which demonstrate that the deficit could have been reduced while still investing in public services. All done without the scale of cuts chosen by the Chancellor.  But that advice has not been taken and now Scotland is dealing with the reality of the Chancellor’s decision  and the tough choices it brings.  Be assured that your SNP Government will defend and protect the vital public services that the people of Scotland depend on: our schools  hospitals and police. We will not sacrifice them to the Chancellor’s austerity obsession. ,2015-12-13T14:16:59+0000,607,1136
