"These are the best """"sugar free"""" (non-enriched wheat flour) crackers I have ever eaten. These are the best & sweetened w/ fruit juice! I am on the sugar busters diet & one of the few snacks you can have is triscuits. Now, you can dress them up, but a reduced fat triscuit is not very satisfying all by itself. I am very finicky about taste & IMO, these are better than Ritz, which can sometimes be too salty. I love these, I can eat 3 or 4 & stop a hunger craving until my next meal or put some smuckers natural peanut butter on them for a more satisfying snack. I promise you, you will not think they taste bad at all. They may not become your fav cracker, but no nasty after tastes or anything negative about them! One last thing, they come in a plastic bag, so I don't feel compelled to eat part or 1/2 of a roll...I just take out a few & close the box.",52147,5
"I buy this regularly at Whole Foods for about $30. The price of this was slightly less, and I didn't have to pay shipping. Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) is a miracle food. I put a tablespoonful in my morning tea, cook with it, and even eat it off a spoon. It curbs my appetite, and helps my blood sugars (I'm diabetic). If you like the taste of coconut, you'll love this product. Nutiva is one of the best tasting VCOs around.",155382,5

"I usually don't particularly like shortbread cookies, especially from Scotland, since I think they're too hard, but I buy it for my mom who loves them, so I picked a box up at Marshall's for $5 and instead of their usual, they had """"vanilla shortbread.""""  The picture of the tender looking stylish cookies looked so yummy in the package that I kept it for myself and tried it.  It's made as a """"light viennese style"""" shortbread which is why it's soooo soft compared to their usual shortbread cookies.  Also, there's a distinctive vanilla taste to it.  There are 12 shortbreads in the 5.3 oz box.",204752,5
"This is good for people that have to be on a sugar free diet but still wants sweet. It doesn't taste any different then regular Splenda.<br />I personally don't like fake sugars but someone in our home has to use them and really likes Splenda.  I find the texture with the B vitamins to be more like real sugar, as regular Splenda is almost fluffy.<br />It comes in single serving packets each consisting of 20% B1, B5, and B6. When you rip open the little foil packets you can smell the vitamins, but again no taste change.<br />Contains Dextrose,Maltodextrin,less than 2% of sucrose,Calcium D-pantothenate(Vitamin B5), pyridoxine hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), Thiamine hydrochloride(vitamin B1).",203651,5
"My uncle Bilbo always woke up to a hearty bowl of porridge in the mornin'. Nothin' goes better with a sunrise in the Shire. If you want your life to be a little simpler, and a lot better, do as Bilbo does, and buy Bob's steel cut oats. There is a goodness inside these little morsels that you don't get with the normal brand, it smells great when you cook it.<br /><br />I take mine with a pat a' butter and a sprinkling of sugar, and as this is the heartiest porridge you can 'ave, some might, as I do, take a wee bit a' milk to thin things out a bit. If you wan't to muck it up with fruit and spices, be my guest, but it's general hobbit practice to keep things as simple as can be.<br /><br />Buy this porridge, and you'll live happily ever after, to the end of your days.",492321,5
"This is the herbal remedy of choice for those times when I something gross, such as anything from McNasty's or Nasty King. I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes.",412107,5
"Just received these today and was stunned to see that one 2 ounce bag is considered to be FOUR servings. Really? Really?? It's the size of a small bag of chips, which one might not realize they were expected to share with three of their closest friends. Serving size disconnect affects so much of the products we buy anyway, but this takes it to a new and quite annoying level.<br /><br />Oh, and the rounds themselves? They have a nice crunch, welcomed when one has been on a low-carb diet of meat and cheese and some veggies, but the flavor is really salty. REALLY salty. And dry. You probably won't be able to eat all four servings anyway, so have a party and put out a couple of the 2 ounce bags of these for the crowd. After a few parties you'll be able to get rid of the twelve bags you just bought.",505976,1

"I have been buying Ella since my son was 6 months old. Once I moved back to the States I was pleased to find the Ella product here. I was also buying Gerber Organic and then one day I studied the label and realized that only Ella was truly just pure veg and fruit whereas the other organic baby food as other random things to help the shelf life. Ella is worth the price and is so easy to mix in with chicken or fish to make it easier for your little one. Although my son is now 16months, I still use Ella when I am short on time and don't have time to make fresh veg or fruit.",180550,5
"Creamy, roasty goodness. Smoother than Nabob and more flavorful than Starbucks Houseblend.<br /><br />Compared to most other  t-discs, this is also a great value at less than 50 cents a cup. Yes, it is a smaller cup but it makes up for its size with quality.",510240,5

"What's not to love about a chocolate glazed donut... without all the fat and gluten? Well, don't get your hopes up that this will take you to that place of guiltless indulgence. However, it's still great coffee and has just a hit of chocolate scent to it.  I added sweetener, a little instant cocoa powder, and half-and-half, and THEN it was more like a chocolate glazed donut.  Still good coffee, just wish the flavor was stronger.",67697,4

It's very smooth, with no bitterness.  I would say that if you enjoy Donut Shop, Tully's Kona, and Caribou, you will like this blend.  The label is adorable and makes me smile when I pop it in the Keurig each morning.",8394,4
"I bought this because my legs and ankles had been swollen badly for over a week and this is not normal for me.  Dandelion leaf tea is supposed to be a diuretic, but I've been drinking it for a couple days and there is no difference that I can tell.<br /><br />When steeped for 12 minutes per the directions for medicinal use the flavor is very """"grassy"""" and rather bitter.  I expected the bitter part from the dandelion leaves, but the grassy flavor is a bit hard to take unless I mix it with other teas, drinking twice as much to get the proper dosage of the dandelion.  I tried adding a little bit of honey in the straight tea to cut the grassy taste but I wound up with too sweet plus bitter.<br /><br />I then bought a couple bunches of fresh parsley and made tea from it.  Cost:  around $2 for enough tea for almost two weeks.  However, you won't need to drink parsley tea for more than 2 days at most to have all that excess fluid removed from your body.  It works:  It's cheap; It's natural, and no paper bags to dispose of! One note:  Parsley tea doesn't taste all that great either but you can add other kinds of tea to help the flavor.<br /><br />Save your money... go to your local grocery store and get the parsley.",160423,2
"My German Shepherd is now on her third bag of ToTW food. She has tried the Wetlands and High Prairie formulas and seems to love both.  The food has high-quality ingredients that are appropriate for a dog's diet.  It's ideal for dogs with allergies and works for dogs of all ages.<br /><br />I would recommend switching foods very slowly because of the potential for diarrhea.  Otherwise, this food is just right for my dog and gives her a shiny coat and lots of energy.  I like that the food is grain-free. Because it has a high nutritional value, dogs can eat less of it per day compared to other foods.  My dog (75 pounds) eats 4 cups a day.<br /><br />TOTW is definitely worth a try if you want your dog to eat healthy!",59710,5

"I bought these for my boys thinking they would like them over Christmas vacation.  Boy was I right!  It was the favorite snack until they were gone.  Sometimes a little oil would accumulate in the cheese compartment, but they boys didn't mention it.  I do think they are a little on the pricy side.  It would be nice to get a price break when you buy them in larger quantities.  So that will probably keep me from buying them again, but they did taste good.",215899,4
"I was really looking forward to the Island Coconut based on other reviews and since I love flavored coffees and coconut I thought to myself """"I can't go wrong.""""  Unfortunately I was totally disappointed - although it smells great, it just tastes weird!  Oh well, you don't know if you don't try.  I'll be offering my leftovers to friends and I'll be curious to know what they think.",236640,2
"Love Crunch - Dark Chocolate & Red Berries is an awesome granola.  I love the balanced taste that the dark chocolate, berries, and granola clusters provide.  I also like that I can easily read and understand the ingredient list.  There's no """"partially blah blah"""" this or """"modified"""" that.  The flavor lives up to the name.  If you like these things, there's a really good chance that you will like this granola.  The only danger is that this relatively small bag has 10 full servings.  While you could use it as a cereal, I use it more as a snack/stop gap between meals.  A few bites mid-morning or afternoon will help bridge the between meal gaps.  There's really nothing not to like about it.  I highly recommend it.",305048,5

"Please do not be fooled as I was when it came to eating this seemingly healthier alternative to regular Cheetos. Also, do not believe everything that is listed from these sellers on packaging or the internet, they are all marketing ploys to get a wider range of consumer to buy their product, in this case they are trying to attract the consumers who are usually very health conscious and read labels. I saw one of the sellers here list this product as having NO MSG.<br /><br />That would seem to be correct because the company has chosen to cleverly market this particular brand to people who are trying to eat healthier. They have changed the name on the ingredients from Monosodium Glutamate to Torula yeast which is a free glutamate. In my opinion if your going to eat and enjoy Cheetos just buy your favorite kind because they are all the same and this bran is no healthier for you than the rest. It's made from GMO corn, and has MSG in it wether thats the name they are going by now days or some new gimmick to poison you, either way your feeding yourself and children unhealthy foods, this should in no way be viewed as a natural alternative to """"regular cheetos."""" I once was fooled and felt I was making a """"healthier"""" junk food choice for my kids when they would want something that I normally wouldn't buy. I was dead wrong and have discontinued this product from my grocery cart. Just thought I would let others know so they can do their own research on the matter.",473932,1
"I normally do not eat prepackaged pudding, since it is full of chemicals, but was trying to find something to mix with canned pumpkin and found a recipe for vanilla pumpkin pudding.  I never buy the typical store pudding, and fortunately, I found the Better Bowls brand on Amazon.  I was so excited to try and was not disappointed when I did.  This pudding is fantastic!<br /><br />When you mix it with milk the sugar content increases, so I tried to make it with almond milk, but the almond milk makes the consistantcy soupy.  They also sell sugar free made with nutrasweet which I refuse to eat, so I hope that they will make a Stevia version some day.  Do not hesitate to try!

"I can't even remember what store I originally discovered these in but I was happy to find them here on Amazon.  Beware the box they come in though as it's rather weak, my chips seemed OK when they arrived but the box was very beaten up and if your delivery guy isn't as good as mine you may end up with some tiny chips.  Even my fiance loves these and he's more of a carnivore, he wouldn't generally think to pick up something veggie like these.  Not that they're all that healthy as they are still potato chips for the most part, but they don't require dip to give them any flavor.",156767,5

The Enjoy Life brand has been consistently good - full flavor, great texture.  Packaging could be better and the price could be lower but for the options available, I'm very pleased.  The chocolate chips in these cookies don't contain soy lecithin which is a huge plus as soy lecithin is in everything these days.  I also highly recommend the Chocolate Brownie cookies.",391543,5
"I have NEVER brewed what I could consider a cup of coffee which tastes as good as fresh roasted beans smell. Even this coffee didn't get all the way around that several lifetimes curse. HOWever, I can say with at least some confidence that these beans are worthy of the praise in reviews.<br /><br />One thing I notice about coffee when it's truly based from a good bean processed with care: It tastes good lukewarm and cool as well as it does hot. Normally I can't stand coffee unless it remains in the hot range. In the case of Cameron's ebony, oily, glossy beans, the coffee I brewed tastes almost better cool than it does hot.<br /><br />I'm in the early phases of stocking my cupboards with certified organic foods, so this is the first of this type of treasured coffee I've purchased. I am absolutely ecstatic to have an organic coffee which even my acid aura can't pH down to bitter, LOL. Just to have quality gourmet organic coffee beans, whoa!<br /><br />I'm almost beginning to feel blessed again.<br /><br />The rest of this review, below, was originally posted as a comment under John Magnotti's thought provoking review [he exposes an endearingly realistic """"coffee snob""""]:<br /><br />Very much enjoyed your clearly stated realism. Interesting observation about ORGANIC bigger than the roast type, and relating it to [attempts to focus] audience.  I had noticed that [priority] subliminally, but not clearly until you noted it.<br /><br />I'm clinging by fingernails in that audience at the moment, though years ago I would have been looking for flavor markers first and only. Now, if it's not organic, I'm crossing forefingers from each hand, warding off a plague or a curse. Been too sick for too long; I'm also crossing fingers in the other way, on one hand, in hopes that the availability will continue for viable, economical, flavorful organic foods.<br /><br />I came to a point not long ago when I was seriously concerned I wouldn't be able to eat anything at all again, due to soy products everywhere, in everything. An intolerance to soy and its accompanying trains of GMO's and toxins can be terrifying in addition to deadly serious.<br /><br />Thankfully increasing magnesium input is helping keep excess toxic intake rapidly """"moving OUT"""" so I can again eat foods from grocery stores and restaurants. But, I'm increasing my stock of ORGANIC from Amazon, to give me a core of sanity, health, and strength for my body to work from. A core of that is all I think I'll need, but it's not quite solid enough yet.<br /><br />IMO, we all have different taste needs, unique genetic structures, and dynamic chemical balances... different """"constitutions""""...<br /><br />Believing that, and believing in free choice, I don't have any desire to limit other peoples' preferences from the marketplace... I just hope to have access to adequate products for my needs to keep me alive and healthy enough to appreciate that state of being... if I'm even right in what I discern my needs to be.<br /><br />Still here but on shaky ground(s),<br />Linda Shelnutt",555272,5

Butter Toffee to me should be sweet so I understand what they are saying.<br /><br />As far as Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee, it is a good tasting cup of coffee and the flavor is consistent.

"There's really not much else to say about this - it's an incredible deal when compared to normal retail prices for saffron.  The saffron is good quality and noticeably fresh (the use-by date on mine was three years away) and it's a fraction of the usual cost.  One thing I particularly liked and that isn't made clear by the description is that this product is actually five one-gram boxes and not one five-gram box, so the saffron in the boxes you haven't opened yet will stay fresh longer.  Still, if you only use saffron every once in a while you'd be better off buying a smaller quantity even if you pay a little more by weight; this is a considerable amount of saffron.  I cook with it regularly so it's great for me, I'm very pleased with this purchase.",91743,5

"At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.

Anyways...I had one girl that seemed itchy and would get hot spots periodically.  After switching to this food the itchyness is completely gone and no hotspots since. They have nice firm poops and I really can't say enough about it. They are all used to high end dog food as I have in the past fed Innova, canidae and was feeding blue buffalo...all of which were good dog foods and for the most part worked really well.  I have always been a fan of grain free food, but most has too high of protien for tiny dogs. Hi quality and certain meat or fish products keep the protien levels in check for small dogs that do not need the high amounts (work dogs and bigger dogs it is fine)...I was so excited to find a grain free food with perfect protien levels (IMO)and it has been wonderful. It is definately a 5* rating in my book.",429127,5

"compared to the usual white bread bun you might not choose this but if you are diabetic or a low carber it is a no brainer. these buns make it possible for us to have a real hamburger and not raise our blood sugar unduely. One thing though, it is better to refrigerate the buns and microwave a few seconds to warm it and not do the usual bbq or toast warming. I have found that microwaving makes reguar bread rubbery but not so the low carb buns (same for their hot dog buns) while the usual warming makes them dry. The ingredients are different and so the warming needed is different. Done this way they do not come out dry and cardboardy. and using more condiments helps also. So I give them a high rating even though the shipping makes them expensive and thus it is worth it for our health.",374638,5

"I am not sure if these are meant just to be used in those coffee makers that make one single cup at a time. I don't have one of those. But I still am enjoying this coffee. I heat water in a mug and then add one of these coffee pods and brew it like a tea bag. I also take a spoon and squeeze water through the pod while it brews in my cup to get a strong coffee out of it.<br /><br />Of all the different coffees I have had, like Dunkin Donuts, Green Mountain, Folgers, and so forth, the coffee this most reminds me of is Starbucks. It is not exactly the same, but I would think someone who likes Starbucks roasts would probably enjoy this.<br /><br />I like the nice box and especially that each coffee pod is individually wrapped to keep them fresh.",153844,5

"I've seen some reviews for these coffee """"pods"""" where people say they used the pod like a teabag, just throwing it into a cup, pouring boiling water over it and letting it steep for a while. Those reviews usually also complain that their coffee is too weak.<br /><br />The coffee is weak because """"teabagging"""" with these pods just doesn't work, in my experience. You need to use a pod coffee brewer, like the <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G"""">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a>, the <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XYLAA"""">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup Stay or Go POD Brewer</a>, or, if you feel like spending a lot of money, maybe the <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00580QKVK"""">SunCafe Coffee Pod Brewer</a>. Personally, since I don't own one of these brewers and I didn't know that """"teabagging"""" doesn't work until I tried it, I ended up tearing open the pods and emptying them into my <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z48XZ0"""">Frieling Coffee-for-One Filter</a>. (Putting an unopened pod into the coffee-for-one filter didn't work either.) The packaging of this product really ought to include some instructions about how to (and how not to) use it.<br /><br />Once I started brewing it correctly, I really liked the flavor of this coffee. I like yirgacheffe coffees in general, and this is a good one. It's a rich, fairly dark roast, with some nice earthy and berry flavors to it.",440955,4

"I adopted two very undernurished kittens from the Humane Society, whose on-staff vet said that AvoDerm dry and canned food is the best on the market for cats. When I took the kittens for their vet checkup 6 months later, my own vet also agreed that this is the best food available and was so pleased with the health of the kittens. My older cats have also seen a huge improvement in their coats -- much more silky and shiny, shedding is reduced and their weight is easily maintained on this food. I recommend trying this food if you have finicky cats or they have health problems.<br /><br />My cats absolutely LOVE all the Avoderm Select Cuts (chunky-style) flavors AND all the flavors of this pate-style food. The seafood flavors seem to be the most popular among the cats, but many vets recommend avoiding too much seafood for male cats due to the urine crystals it can cause. I started feeding the beef and chicken exclusively and they eat every last drop.<br /><br />Bottom line: It costs more than your average food, but it's worth every penny (buying it by the case can give you a pretty good discount from most vendors). If you consider that it keeps them healthier, which can save you from expensive vet bills in the long run, then it's worth it. Plus, think of the time you'll save not having to clean up after their shedding! Also, I've noticed that this brand does not result in the runny, smelly poo that some other, cheaper brands do. Try this food out on your cats -- you'll be pleasantly surprised.",557930,5

I make chicken curry with it. First I cook the vegetables(potatoes, celery, carrots, etc.) and add pieces of cooked chicken and the sauce.

"I LOVE these snacks.  Okay, not for me, for my son.  He's now 16 months and has been eating them for at least 6 months.  They are great first snacks when baby has no teeth to chew because they melt in your mouth.  They are light and airy and really easy for baby to eat.  My son recently got some his molars and wouldn't chew anything.  It's was down to yogurt and the puffs.  They worked beautifully.  At this point, he's got enough teeth that I'm upgrading him to a little bit more crunchy food, but these puffs have been great.  We've tried the banana, apple and green and he likes them all.  Only bad thing is that they go stale REALLY QUICKLY!!! Gotta keep them in the container.  If you put them in a snack cup, they will be stale in less than 12 hours. They turn chewy and not so good.",188117,5

I can attest to the fact that it has a very long shelf life, because I bought all mine at the same time, from a store that was getting rid of it, and my latest bottle tastes just like the first one.<br /><br />The best thing about this oil is that it gives you the taste of heat, but not the actual heat. The name is somewhat misleading. To me, it is not hot at all, but tastes like it should be. I love it for spicing up soups, etc., when I am not in the mood for burning throat and watering eyes, which I am sometimes! Makes an excellent substitute for Tabasco, and doesn't have the vinegar base. It is of course oil based.<br /><br />Try it!",43449,5

"These chips have great flavor as is but I am more into the buffalo wings flavor more than the bleu cheese flavor, but it's a combo that seems to work well, I probably would like it even more if it just had the heat and flavor of just the buffalo wing sauce.

"I recently received a roll of this jerky chew, and will say that THIS is what jerky chew should be like! I have previously tried and reviewed the <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZI0RG"""">Jack Links Chew, Original Flavor, 0.32-Ounce Units (Pack of 24)</a>. That stuff tasted like ground up cardboard and pepper that blows away when you open the can. Buffalo Bill's chew is has plenty of flavor, but also is actual shredded (not ground) jerky. The only fault is that occasionally you might get a little chunk that's too big for your lip, which makes it kind of painful. But I usually just chew those right up anyhow. This chew is neither too dry nor too moist.<br /><br />I like to use jerky chew when riding horses or working in dusty conditions, as it helps keep my mouth moist. And though it's not laced with caffine or nicotine, it does help keep you awake because it keeps your mouth and mind busy.<br /><br />I will say without a doubt that this is the best jerky chew I've tried thus far. Even my kids like it!",249859,5
"Medium roast, mellow coffee with little or no bitterness.  We drink this for our everyday coffee - made in a french press.  It has a nice coffee flavor with no noticable overtones.  Occassionally when I leave a cup, I rewarm it in the microwave.  This actually tastes quite acceptable that way as long as I don't boil it - many other coffees end up with an off taste after the microwave.  Still, it is better fresh out of the pot though.",141233,5

"I just got 2 jars of Roland Mushrooms, Dried Sliced Cepes - Bolets from Amazon.com at $16.35 for a 1lb jar. I thought it is deal to good to be true, but I bought it anyway. Right after opening the jar I realized I made a big mistake. Mushrooms, and especially bolets should pleasantly smell and not stink. The content of the jar stinks. I am not sure if such mushrooms are appropriate for human consumption. Of course, I paid for it and I will Try it. However, I think I discovered the reason for this stink. You see, I purchased some other Roland products, like sliced olives, roasted paprika, etc. On sliced olives for example it says """"Packaged for 2010 Roland Company..."""", and on Roasted paprika it says """"Packaged for 2011 Roland Company..."""" But on the jar with Roland Mushrooms, Dried Sliced Cepes - Bolets it says """"Packaged for 2001 Roland Company.."""" Is it possible that Amazon.co is selling Roland Mushrooms stored for the past 10 years? Unfortunately, there is no expiration date on the jar. Anyway, a freshly opened jar of dried bolets with clearly defined expiration date I purchased in a local store (1 year before expiration date) smells a lot different.",160910,1

"I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason.

Now I'm eager to get the gluey, sodden mess it created out of my house.<br /><br />The texture is a total disaster: it breaks apart before the pasta is even to al dente stage. The result is a melange of crumbling broken bits of half-cooked product that has the texture and (presumed) flavor of wet fiber-board.  My dogs (who will eat most anything), wouldn't even touch it.<br /><br />If you are from the school of thought that those who must eat gluten-free deserve only the worst of textures and flavors -- then this is for you.  If you're from the other school -- one that says we're entitled to flavor and texture to rival that of other grain products -- just pass this up and order one of the corn-based pastas.",100401,1

However, this new multi-insert packaging allows you to use fewer crackers at a time without exposing the rest of the crackers in the box to the air.  There are six smaller packages within each large box instead of the traditional two.  That means the unused packages retain their freshness seal rather than allowing the crackers to become stale like an open package would.

"This product has many claims, making it appear healthy. A quick look at the nutritional information, however, shows somewhat otherwise. Each bar is 180 calories, which is a good mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. Total fat, though, is 9g, with 2g saturated fat. Fortunately, it provides 2g of fiber and 2g of protein. Everybody's needs are different, but this product is just outside my range of what I consider a """"healthy snack"""".<br /><br />Most of the ingredients are """"organic"""", which is a plus. They are also sweetened with agave and coconut sugar. However, for my personal taste -- and I have quite a sweet-tooth -- this product is too sweet for me. Perhaps it's the chocolate, or one of the other sweetening ingredients, but by the time I finish the bar, I'm reaching for something to drink to cut the sweetness. The benefit of this is that the bar is a good candy-substitute if you are craving a sweet treat in the afternoon hours.<br /><br />The texture is good -- this bar is like a heavy oatmeal cookie. There's nothing hard or crunchy in it. It's very soft and chewy.<br /><br />If it weren't for what I characterize as an extreme sweetness, I could give this product a higher rating.",15243,3

They're slightly chewy, with a creamy type inside filling, and come in other flavors too. They lasted a bit longer since I was eating less per portion, but the dogs just loved them. They would see me starting to peel the wrappers, and almost instantly get into sitting position without me saying a word. There's no chocolate, raisins or other ingredients that would be bad for them, and I limit the total amount too. Don't want diabetic dogs, just happy ones.<br />  The price was reasonable for the amount I got. It was shipped quickly and tasted fresh. I'll be buying more soon.",438018,5

These are a GREAT alternative to a brownie or other dessert when you feel like indulging without the guilt.  All of these bars have very few ingredients and are made of mostly  fruit and nuts. I also find that just 1 bar is satisfying.<br /><br />These are a good pick if you like dark chocolate.  If you are more of a milk chocolate person you will probably still like them, however they are less sweet and creamy than milk chocolate is, more bittersweet.<br /><br />If you haven't tried these you need to.  With around 200 calories per bar or less, these bars are like having a brownie with less than half the calories.",376546,5

"Acceptable tea, with a light gold colouring, and weighty single bags.  Despite the amount of tea per bag, the tea is not very strong, even with a long 5+min soaking. As such, it will not accept too much cream or sugar either. This is fine in itself, as the tea has a nice flavour, a blend of Assam and Kenyan teas. Its taste and strength are similar to PG Tips or more closely Typhoo.  Makes a pleasant, late evening tea, but was expecting more out of this popular Irish blend. For those preferring a much stronger, darker tea you may want to find another brand.",421158,3

"Let me start off by saying, I love Nong Shim bowl noodles!  At this price, I couldn't pass them up!<br /><br />I prefer the original spicy, but decided to give the Spicy Seafood a try this time.  There is a fishy scent, which I found unappealling at first, but have since learned to live with.  Also, this variety is not nearly as spicy as I would prefer, and certainly less spicy than the original flavor bowls.  There are bits of dried crab and shrimp in the bowls, along with nice size pieces of mushroom and green onion (and other vegetables as well).  As with other Shim products, the noodles taste great and seem to be a better quality than other brands of instant noodles.<br /><br />I add a few dashes of tabasco, black pepper and a pinch of garlic powder before adding the water.  This takes care of the fishy smell (for the most part) and brings the spiciness level up as well.",295806,4

I can't speak for all the flavors (yet), but the look of joy when I ate this cookie made my hubby grab the box to make me share.....We agree....this one is a keeper, especially if you love chocolate and peanutbutter flavors together.  Not that you would be looking, but the calorie count on these are 170 for 3 cookies.

"The 60s decade box I ordered arrived in tact, and all the candy inside the box was in fine shape, (nothing was smashed or cracked), each item was full sized and fine.<br />I only gave 3 stars for the selection. Allthough the pieces were indeed items enjoyed in the 60s, I felt the inclusion of candy that is still sold commonly today somewhat took away from the nostalgia, ( an O Henry Bar as one example). The variety of candies may differ for others as stated in the item description, so my minor dissapointment in the selction I recieved will not be everyone's experience. I also recieved a duplicate of one of the candies. For the price I felt it should overall have been a better variety of 60s candies.<br />On a final note, and it bears repeating, the candies were all in fine shape so the quality of each item in the box was not compromised. I only feel the nostalgic value of the items would be at say 60% for what I recieved. I feel it is worth perhaps half the price I paid. (not including s&h).",239231,3

"I love these salt and pepper flavored Popchips.  The bag size is perfect for a snack.  I love them in the afternoon when I get home from work, or at lunch with a sandwich.  Of course since they are """"salt and pepper"""", there's a lot of salt.  I have to watch my sodium intake and it limits the number of bags I can eat.  Also, I would like to see the salt and pepper flavor included in the variety box instead of the vinegar, which I don't like at all.  Tastes too strong of vinegar.  Would be great for someone who absolutely loves vinegar.  It would also be nice if you could create your own variety box with the flavors you most prefer.  It does get a little boring eating 24 bags the same flavor.",23718,4
"My experience with Vivani organic dark chocolates so far -- regular, espresso, now green tea -- is that they are purist to the point of austere. If just snapping off a square of two to savor, a little goes a long way.  While the espresso bar had plenty of espresso flavor, however, I can barely detect a green tea taste in this green tea bar, at most a very faint herbal bitterness, although the ingredients list (not on Amazon's product page) does cite """"green tea (2%).""""  I do trust this 2%, since Germany, where this is made, is very strict with food inspections and labeling.  But 2% doesn't sound like much.  As someone who loves green tea and its sundry flavoring applications like mochi and soymilk, I was disappointed.<br /><br />Loath to waste, I began baking with it, grating between half and a full bar's worth into my usual chocolate cake recipe.  Wow.  For some reason it adds such dimension to the cake's sweetness.  Still not quite """"green tea"""" but subtler and more intriguing than straight-up dark chocolate.  Have already made (and been complimented on) three of those cakes.  So I'm now quite grateful to have it on hand, and might even repurchase, but strictly for baking.",460752,4

"One of the ingredients on the label is """"Natural Flavors"""" which is glutamate in hiding.  Glutamate is a neuro toxin which can destroy your dog's health.  The company is very deceptive.  They avoid giving a direct answer.  They call glutamate a vegetable extract which it indeed is, however, when one component is extracted, it creates an imbalance that can be harmful.  I will say this.  My dogs like it, but that is the purpose of glutamate, a flavor enhancer.  Added later:  Why should anything need to be extracted to enhance the flavor of quality food for pets or humans for that matter.  I now make many of my dogs meals from mostly raw ingredients and give them Organix dog food when I need a quick meal.

Just read the ingredients list and you will quickly recognize what it really is: sugared water with some flavors in it.<br /><br />A brave self-test revealed a strong artificial taste, root-canal-pain inducing sweetness, immediate scratching and itching in the back of my throat, chemical aftertaste - just totally and utterly horrible.<br />A burst of flavor, as the advertising claims? Rubbish.<br /><br />And something else happened to me, which was already described by other reviewers - as soon as I opened the package, a very fine dust emitted which immediately made me cough and gasp for air. I just hope, this stuff is just bad tasting and not toxic on top of it ...<br />Very rarely, I bemoan the  fact that Amazon makes you give at least one star at the review. For this product, I would like to have the opportunity to give no star at all ...",504701,1

"Who Buys a Kuerig and drinks Decaf? This was a good mix but almost half of them were decafs, One of the K cups was opened too so the box was filled with grounds.

"I know nettle tea has a pretty distinct taste, but this particular brand was just unbearable. The smell reminded me of fish food pellets, and it had a fishy taste, too. I bought a pound of loose nettles from somewhere else for a lot cheaper, and the taste is so much better.",299437,1
"I normally buy this seasoning in the grocery store however it comes in the same canister with 2 other seasonings that we don't use nearly as much as this one. In addition to the 3 seasonings being hard to find in the grocery store, now I can get the only one that we use and stop wasting the other 2. This stuff makes everything taste so good! I normally use it for italian dipping sauce for bread, but put it in some burger meat last night and the burgers were wonderful!",234267,5
"However this is not authentic southern sweet. It can be, if you add 2 tablespoons or more of granulated sugar to each 6 ounce cup you brew.

I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add the rest of the water just to make these palatable.

"I got my most recent 3 pack product in April and two of the three boxes had kcups that had expanded - I mean that the bottom was round and puffed out.  When put in the Keurig, a couple of them popped at the top and spritzed/leaked coffee out of the keurig and onto my counter.  The others crumpled when used.  We pay a lot of money for kcups and I encourage you to check all three boxes when you get them to make sure they are normal.  I am wondering what kind of extremes the packages are subjected to in storage and/or transit.  One of the three boxes had all kcups as they should be (sealed tight, flat bottoms).

"I was very excited about this, but hesitant to believe some of the claims people had made.  I bought some unsweetened grapefruit juice, strawberries, pineapple, and a lemon.  The tablet took a long time to disolve, like how many licks to get to the center long, but it was worth it.  I ate the lemon, it was almost like an orange and it wasn't sour at all until about 15 minutes in.  The grapefruit juice tasted like it had a pound of sugar in it, and the strawberries tasted like icecream.  It didn't last quite as long for me as some reviews listed and I used the full tablet.  There were some residual effects for the next 30 minutes after sour started tasting sour again... like the tomato sauce in a slice of pizza tasted sweet.

"I've only ever used the curry pastes they sell in my local chain supermarket. It comes in a tiny jar, is $7, and has such little flavor I almost need to use an entire jar every time I make curry.<br /><br />After doing some Amazon searches for curry paste this one seemed to have the most, and best, ratings. And it has  A LOT of paste in the container! So I ordered it. I figured if Thai folks use this curry, it must be good.<br /><br />And it is! It's the best, and now my curry rivals that of the local restaurants. We don't go out for curry anymore, since it takes less than 30 minutes to make one that tastes just as good.<br /><br />The container is huge, and it will take months for me to work through it even if I make curry once per week.<br />When I first smelled the curry I was a little afraid to use it. The spices are definitely in there, and I started to sneeze from the chili! But I tried it and all the scariness of the curry went away. It smelled amazing, the amount of kick was perfect, and it was not overwhelming.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and I will definitely stock up.

"Lindt truffles is my husband's favorite chocolate.  Whenever family or friends take a trip to the US, I always  grab the chance to buy it for him.  In that past, it was hassle-free as it would be a store purchase.  Today is the first time I buy it through Amazon.com where I've had pleasant online shopping experiences in the past.  Today is a different story, I place the order at 2-day shipping thinking it would arrive at my friend's hotel by Sept. 17 or 18 at the latest.  I get an order confirmation email from Amazon telling me that the estimated delivery date would be Sept. 20-21 -- my friend would no longer be at her hotel to recieve the delivery.  So I hurriedly log on to my Amazon account to change the order details, either to make it overnight delivery so it arrives sooner or to change the delivery address.  The Amazon system was faulty and could not display my order.  Heck, it could not display any of my orders in the past year even.  It took two hours and still the website displayed sorry can not display your order.  So I place an international long distance call to Amazon customer service to see what they can do and they say it's not showing up in their system.  Great.  In a few minutes though, they email me saying that it finally showed up in their system and that they can't do anything about it since it's a third party seller (Lindt).  So they direct me instead to get in touch with Lindt.  They can change the delivery details or cancel my order altogether and I can just re-order with the correct delivery details.  So I place another international long distance call this time to Lindt, who says it's not showing up in their system.  They suggest I get back to Amazon.  Which I did and again they re-direct me to Lindt.  Back and forth a few more international phone calls later, Lindt tells me to call back in 3 and a half hours to see if it will be up in their system.  How ridiculous is this??  My bill for this order is just US$40 but I'm spending more on the phone calls just to cancel the freaking order which should not be my problem had the Amazon website been up and running instead of saying it can't display my order.<br /><br />What is more stressful in this entire experience is neither Amazon nor Lindt offered any smarts in problem solving or trouble-shooting.  They did not exhibit good customer service behaviour either.<br /><br />Very, very, very disappointing.",204579,1

"I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.<br /><br />With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.<br /><br />The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.<br /><br />I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.<br /><br />Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!<br /><br />Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again. Please keep up the good job, great service and outstanding roses you have.",11595,5
"Like most herring products, MW Polar Herring Fillets in Mustard is delicious.  However, MW Polar makes the mistake of adding vegetable oil to this product.  I've eaten many cans of sardines in tomato sauce from Thailand and they taste delicious despite the fact that no vegetable oil is added.  The fat from the sardines is more than enough to make the tomato paste delicious.  Herring tastes a little better than sardines even though these 2 fish species look almost exactly alike.  MW Polar should stop adding vegetable oil to their herring products because the fat from the herring is more than enough to make it delicious.<br />Some scientists are worried, based on experiments with lower animals, that cetoleic acid (an omega-11 fatty acid), which comprises about 10% of herring fat, could be cardiotoxic to humans.  Sardine fat is only about 1% cetoleic acid.  I personally am not worried about eating plenty of the cetoleic acid in herring fat because the Inuit Eskimos of Greenland, who hunt and eat marine mammals in addition to fish, ingest about 100 times the cetoleic acid of most American fish eaters.  Result:  Cardiovascular disease is virtually nonexistent among the Inuit Eskimos of Greenland despite the fact that they are the world's heaviest cigarette smokers!",251654,4

"Melitta is the sort of coffee you'd often find in a gift basket from a nicer department store or housewares store, and for good reason. The packaging is nice, the aroma is decent, and the coffee is so middle-of-the-road that it's likely to be well-received by just about anyone used to pre-ground national brands.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor tastes artificial, but isn't overpowering. The coffee itself is, again, a true medium roast. Light drinkers will probably go """"Ooh! That's a little strong."""" while dark drinkers will probably say """"Well, at least it's not watery.""""<br /><br />So, as part of a gift, you really can't go wrong (unless the recipient is a strict decaf person), but keeping it around regularly doesn't make much sense to me.

"Absolutely LOVE this toy. We recently purchased this for our 8 month old French Bulldog after our trainer suggested feeding him by hand to prevent him from gobbling up his meals in 2 seconds as Frenchies do. While that's great in theory, there are many times we just can't sit and feed him his kibble bit by bit. We tried several Kong type products and he was able to either get his food out too quickly or grew bored and never ate. This toy makes him really work for his food and because he can see the food through the tube it really keeps his interest. My only gripe is that the plastic tube could be more sturdy. I love that it's see through but his jaws of steel have already done some damage to it, but perhaps we just need to experiment with a larger size (we have the small now) We've only had it a short time so I can't speak too much for longevity but for now it is an amazing solution.",234506,5

Wow, this stuff doesn't even taste like what I had originally! It has an awful burnt taste that lingers as an aftertaste. It really doesn't even compare to what I had before. They must have changed the beans or reduced the quality because it is not smooth at all and has a bitterness and aftertaste that reminds me of the lingering taste after smoking a cigarette. I've decided to switch brands completely. No returns it so I'm stuck with 3 1/2 bricks of sub-par coffee grounds.",517889,1

"Well, this is the kit I tried first, and the back row of plants & center front are doing the best.  Both basils shoot right out of their pods.  The Dill and Cilantro are growing tall, and there is lots of mint, but it is tiny.  The chives are looped back into the sponge & have yet to try to stand up straight, and the Oregano is sprouting within the sponge, but has yet to come out of hiding.  And this is at the beginning of week 2.  I believe I could probably harvest a little basil at the end of week 3.<br /><br />The big question is, where is the Parsley?  People have suggested they substitute Parsley for Oregano.  I'd rather they replace the Red Rubin basil.  I have recipes with oregano, but none specifically calling for purple basil.  However, I never tasted the stuff, so I may change my mind once I do.  Hopefully they included it becase of taste and not for looks.<br /><br />This is an easy, low maintenence kit.  You only have to refil the water bowl when the water gets low & add 2 nutrient tablets every 2 weeks.  It comes with 2 starter nutrients, 2 sprouting nutrients & 12 regular nutrient tablets  They ask you to place the pods in the order they came in the box.  Possibly because of slightly variable light levels.

"Tying to find a tea that didn't have that bitter taste was difficult; and the cost of teas is not cheap anymore.  I was trying many of the healing teas, but they had stevia added to them and I could not get past the taste of that.  This tea is not bitter, and has a very nice smooth flavor.  I have had it both hot and cold.  I do feel that I am energized after drinking it, but it is not a jittery hyper feeling; it is more of an awake and alert feeling mentally and refreshed energized physical feeling.  Some reviewers state it has a sweet taste to it but I do not get that.  While I do not often add my 1/2 packet of sugar in the raw to it perhaps that is what they mean; that you do not have to add sugar to it.  I have replaced my second cup of coffee in the morning with this tea and I even have another cup throughout the day instead of coffee.  Excellent taste and an all around great product.",7421,5

I must say....I look forward to getting up in the morning just because I know I'm having this coffee!! TAHT SAYS A LOT FOR A LTE SLEEPER!! Try this one!! I like it on thenext to highest setting on my Keurig....it has an awesome aroma while brewing and the taste is smooth, never bitter and there is something that 'hints' of a slight fruitiness with the first sips......then the end of the sip is just a perfect brew, too. Never any aftertaste or bitterness. I am so happy to have found this!! Thanks Wolfgang! I have now ALL of your kitchen gadgets cookware and now the coffee too!",8489,5

I am not a die hard organic person, but I do buy organic cherries, and other soft fruit thing - don't buy organic bananas because the skins are so thick that it doesn't really matter, etc. Realistically the fact that there is BPA in the lids doesnt affect the food or the quality of it. BPA is an element in plastics that is excess estrogen and its recently become known that its not beneficial to let it enter our bodies. However, BPA is only activated once its been heated and since you arent heating the metal lid, the BPA never enters the food. EB baby food is spectacular especially since its jar food vs frozen/fresh. There are lots of yummy flavors and your baby will probably like most of them. Both of my sons go crazy over the EB varieties and I stick by it- buying it by the case and using the amazon subscription option makes it soo much cheaper than retail!

It keeps that same flavor profile you know and love. On the smallest setting, it's still not as strong as some of the more extreme extra bolds, but those are usually the nastiest tasting K-Cups.

"I eat a lot granola bars as a snack or part of my lunch. Some like Nature Valley have so much sugar to approach being a candy bar minus the chocolate coating. I avoid high fructose corn syrup and try to eat as much whole wheat products as possible, which typically means buying granola bars from companies like Kashi.

"Beetlejuice is coming back to DVD in a newly remastered 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, in both standard definition and Blu-ray, on September 16th, 2008.  The extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series (""""Skeletons in the Closet,"""" """"Spooky Boo-tique,"""" """"A-Ha!""""), and for the Blu-ray version an exclusive CD soundtrack sampler.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but don't count on it.  The new Blu-ray will be 1080p video, but the specs for the sound haven't been announced.<br /><br />Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's """"Banana Boat Song"""" (""""Day-O""""), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />If you don't have the old, not-so-great DVD, the new release might be worth waiting for.  Amazon has a page to pre-order the new standard DVD <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AGXEAG"""">here</a>.

Emerald's Cocoa Roasted Almonds (Dark Chocolate) are an excellent solution to this one drawback.  The chocoalte does not make your hands a mess and you stil get the great taste.<br /><br />One warning perhaps is that this resembles cocoa powder than the form of chocolate one normally gets in a candy bar or in chocolate coated nuts.  It has less of the sweetness than that and more of a bite.  Perhaps an acquired taste, it is none the less excellent and a real treat.",44726,5

"I bought this at a local import store. I was excited and kind of scared to try it. It's very good. I've never liked liver, and this has a livery flavor, but it's just livery enough to taste strong and interesting, but not revoltingly strong. I thought the smell did remind me of dog food, but it's saltier than dog food (yes, I've tasted dog food). It melts in your mouth, it's very soft and tender in texture, and the oats are chewy. It's fairly greasy. I hope to try this someday the traditional way with the skin, as the other reviews I've read for this product claim it tastes nothing like the real thing. It definitely tastes like nothing I've ever eaten before, and I would highly recommend trying it. It doesn't take much to get satisfaction form it. I guess it kind of reminds me of chopped liver (which I never liked as a kid, but I might like it now), only warm, and less strong in the liver flavor. I've had chicken hearts and I can taste the heart flavor, which I might be confusing with liver, as I like chicken hearts. I can imagine it would taste good with cheese.",438497,4
"I am obsessed with VIA.  It tastes just like Starbucks Fresh Brewed Coffee.  I highly recommend it for those on a budget or hurry.  Amazon has a great 50 count purchase deal.  I have tried both Columbia and Italian Roast.  Both are great just depends on how strong you like your coffee.",110660,5

I put it in soups, on salads, on vegetables and without question meat.<br />My husband travels so I eat alone a lot.

Also on the plus side the Nature's Path variety does not use high fructose corn syrup (unlike Kellogg's).  This makes the Nature's Path slightly more expensive, but it is worth it.

"These are not the same as regular rice krispie treates, but my GFCF kiddo likes them and they are awfully convenient.  Only wish they would keep labeling the individual packaging so I know what the item is.",187838,4
"I've used this item for stunning drink presentations but have routinely been entertaining """"self"""" at home.  The syrup's amazing and the flower is edible.  The flower stuns everyone at first but when they taste, they thoroughly enjoy.  I have purchased this a number of times.  Amazon use to carry the larger, 11 oz. jar but I did not see it on this last purchase.  This product's become a staple in my house. I also use the syrup to mix with other items (fruit dips, desserts, ice cream, etc.)",20210,5
"I purchased these about 2 weeks ago along with the Sour Patch Green Apple ones which i did a review on and once again these really lack the sour that Sour Patch is known for. However these do have a good watermelon flavor but still lack a good sour flavor. If you lick a good gummy watermelon flavor then this aren't as bad. I would try a small package 1st before buying a bigger one to see if it's what your taste buds want.",171823,3
"I ordered this item because some acquaintances on a cooking forum were raving about Dukes Mayo being far superior to Best Foods/Hellman's Mayonnaise.  I can't get Duke's here in California, so I ordered four 48oz. jars!!  This is a tasteless excuse for mayonnaise!!  The flavor is just plain flat.  I'll be sticking to Best Foods Mayonnaise from now on.  Wish I could send back the other three jars for a refund.",121561,2
"This is a very good tasting coffee for being half-caf. I like this because I have to watch caffine because of my stomach. I will be ordering more, the taste is very good.",378723,4
"I got these thinking they'd be a great healthy snack to take to work for in between meals. While they taste great, they're not healthy. They're kind of a cross between a cookie and a cracker. They taste really good - not too sweet, and the blueberry flavor doesn't taste fake. Taste-wise, these get a 5 all day long.<br /><br />Inside the package is one of those trays like Chips Ahoy come in. It would be easy to eat a whole row of these (maybe 15-20 thins). But if you did that, you'd be eating 933 calories and 33 grams of fat! A serving size is just 3 thins, and even though they are kind of big, they're still...well thin. So 3 thins might work as a dessert if you pre-ration them, but otherwise I think you're always going to want more than 3 to be satisfied.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed is 'uncbleached enriched flour,' and 'whole grain wheat flour' doesn't make an appearance until about halfway down the list. It does have soy in it, and the fruit flavor seems to come only from dried blueberries and no weird stuff. The ingredient list is pretty short, which is nice. Nutriton-wise, it only has 2g of dietary fiber and nothing really notable for vitamins. I'm a bit disappointed. You'd think something called 'newton fruit thins' would have some redeeming nutrional quality, but these don't. It wouldn't be hard to make them a more healthy snack, and I wish Nabisco had done that.<br /><br />Despite how good they taste, the serving size/calories/fat issue makes them not a good buy for me, because they're just not a healthy snack. They're junk food disguised as a healthy snack, which might even be worse than plain old junk food.",316842,3
"Are you the type of person that always needs a side bag of chips to accompany their lunchtime sandwich but then feels pangs of guilt afterward for consuming that extra 120-200 trans-fat laden empty calories? If so, FoodShouldTasteGood's line of nutritious tortilla chips strikes an effective balance between satisfying your junk food cravings while providing some nutritional benefit by way of high quality ingredients and a few grams of fiber to boot.<br /><br />The most important factor though is that with their 'Multigrain' line of tortilla chips (think of a corn tortilla chip that's tasty yet packed with such whole grain goodness like flax, sunflower and sesame seeds as well as oat fiber, brown rice, quinoa and soy - yes please!) the taste itself is good enough to convince the staunchest junk-food addicts to reach into that bag for yet another bite. These chips go well with everything from sandwiches to soups as well as served plain by itself. These chips are tasty enough with the right crisp texture you've come to know and expect from your standard snack tortilla morsel. Great product all around.",92667,4

I came on to order a case of a different flavor to try.<br /><br />I'm giving 4 stars because the packaging could be better.  The cap and lid doesn't stay on that well.  I think I will have to put a peice of masking tape on the next container.  I do wish there was no sugar in them, but it does have much less than other puffs.  I like the organic ingredients of course.  And the price w/ subscribe and save is cheaper than convetional products at the store.",188136,4

The tray makes perfect-sized serving portions, and clean-up is very easy.  We run hot water over the back of each cup for one or two seconds, and the frozen food pops right out.  We store the individual servings in ziplock sandwich bags, makes it really easy to grab his food for the day and go.",13460,5
"I've been buying this coffee via subscribe and save for a few years now. It's my husband's favorite!

I have since cancelled future shipments. I am disappointed in the extreme increase in price in comparison to other like products.I realize that coffee prices are on an upswing (again), but this was a little more than I can accept.",272976,4

"I have real issues trying to find a K-cup that will give me a robust-tasting enough mug of joe. For a while, I'd found near-perfection in the Coffee People extra bold mix... especially the Wake-Up Call (which got horribly expensive all of a sudden), but even those I only made on the middle setting of our brewer, and never the largest.  The Double Black Diamond still satisfied me on the largest setting, and has an intense, smoky dark edge that reminds me of the coffee that first converted me to the Pacific Northwest style of espresso---one I had a a tiny, roadside espresso stand out in the middle of nowhere between Tumalo and Sisters, in Oregon.  (It's probably not there any more--this was back in the 90s. LOL)  Anyway, it's definitely robust, and as I use milk/creamer, I don't find it bitter at all, but rich and worthy of savoring.  It will stand up nicely to a shot of your favorite flavor, and even shines through getting mixed with cocoa and vanilla for a toasty mocha.<br /><br />I just wish the coffees I'm finding out that I really, really like weren't shooting up into the """"Can't Afford"""" ranges. But for those who love bold, smoky dark roast---this one is a real winner! I will keep it on hand for the times when I sit down with breakfast or with my Kindle to savor a cup of coffee rather than drink it in haste on the way out the door. But, if I find this coffee """"loose"""" I'm getting it for my Eko-Brew reuseable K cups for sure.",337391,4
"I don't know what Bahlsen was thinking over the last several months, but I looked high and low for these cookies in supermarkets and specialty stores...none were to be found.

"This coffee smells really bad - there is definitely no """"delicious"""" smell as it brews or as you take sips from your mug.  It tastes just as awful too.  The first couple sips that I had, with my nose closed so I couldn't smell it, wasn't too bad but the more sips I took the more disgusting it was.  It is absolutely stomach turning (to me at least) and unfortunately I will never drink the whole bag. It tastes like a weak, poorly brewed, cheap cup of coffee (though not cheap!).  The only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder - just irritated my nose and taste buds.",3125,2

They contain high maltose corn syrup, and that surprised me.  I have been researching this additive, and it doesn't seem to be AS bad as high """"fructose"""" corn syrup (though research is limited), but is a corn syrup nonetheless.  It also goes by maltodextrin or malt sugar, and is the primary sugar used in beer. More information is available on the web and at [...]<br />Read about it and decide for yourselves.  As for me, I choose to avoid another questionable ingredient(that is way too close to high fructose corn syrup) until proven otherwise. Too bad, because these granola thins were delicious.",236112,4

I mixed with some off the shelf dry food.  No Joy!.  Finally ended dousing it with some chicken broth.  That got their attention.  Risk Reward decisions were quickly calculated and they ate.

While the White Chocolate is rich & smooth as it melts in your mouth. A fairly unique taste & better than some of the more pricier brands. When your trying to watch your weight, but have a burning need for something sweet a couple of these miniatures will hit the spot without expanding ones spare tire.",525367,4
"Mom's Spaghetti Sauce is truly the best out there! It has whole garlic cloves, basil leaves, and tomato chunks.

Since moving to the west coast, I have not been able to find it.  I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon!  The only issue I have is the cost so it has to be a special occasion item.  It is most certainly worth the cost it just adds up when you have to pay shipping too.  I wish my local stores carried it!!!",545186,5
"The title says it all, but seriously this stuff is great. I've tried other high fiber cereals, like Kashi, that just taste like leaves and twigs. This cereal tastes great and it's high in fiber.

"There are two apple flavors in the bag, as shown by the red/green v white/green candies.  The red/green is a bit less tart than the white/green, with an excellent apple flavor.

In short, there are no other candies with this apple flavoring out there, making this a must buy.",215862,5

Sure it was hot (which I love) but it had the best taste of any horseradish by far, and I've even made horseradish from scratch.

"I find I have grown somewhat addicted to having one of these crisps every morning with my coffee - they're not terribly filling because the crisps are relatively thin, but if like me you just need a little something to munch on in the morning these are the perfect pick.  Easy to grab and go, delicious, crunchy, all that you could look for in the morning.  Nice to buy them on sale or in bulk because they can be expensive.<br /><br />I like both fruit flavors of this product, but not as much the chocolate or cinnamon flavors.  I'm hoping they'll introduce more fruit flavors in the future.",229252,5

If you are trying to follow a low-carb lifestyle (for dietary reasons or weight loss) and need a 'sweet fix' after meals, then this is a wonderful option - only 6 g. Net carbs!

"Although I originally was hoping this would be a nice alternative to normal tea or coffee, I just was wrong.  It was incredibly strong.  I wasn't even able to get through a half mug of it.  I sort of liked the basics of the taste;  there was just too much taste.  I cannot recommend this unless you want a VERY heavy taste of ginger.  I think it would have been far better if it was mild ginger.",45691,2

"I make the best brewed iced tea with this yellow label Lipton tea. I make it by the gallon using the same amount as regular loose teas. I only add 1/4 cup of sugar per gallon. This tea has quickly replaced soda and tastes even better. After opening, I transfer the entire contents into a glass container (not plastic) with a metal screwed lid to keep the air out. We love this tea and hope Amazon keeps carrying it.",407343,5
"These taste pretty good, but let's be real, they are a glorified candy bar with unhealthy oils and next to no nutrients. And at this price, it comes to about $1.00 per bar. I would recommend waiting for a sale at the grocery store or choosing a healthier bar altogether. This is a rip off.",218227,2
"I should have read the other reviews more carefully before purchasing these for our Australian Shepard. These bones are so tiny he just looks ridiculous with them.  Even more, I have to watch him with them because they are so small that I am worried they are going to get lodged in his throat while he is trying to eat them (which takes less than 5 minutes).",347759,1
"The smell is what tells you your dealing with the Bhut Jolokia. The taste and heat are what get you coming back to the bottle. On a 1-10 heat scale I'd rate this sauce at a 6.5 - 7. 1 Would be a basic jalapeno sauce and 10 being a raw ghost chili. This sauce has an incredible smell to it. You can smell the floral-ness of the ghost and habanero. The sauce although hot isn't extreme out of the gate. If you use this on wings, nacho, etc it will build but adds great flavor unlike many other """"ghost"""" sauce. In comparison this is 100x more palatable than Dave's ghost chili sauce.<br /><br />I've gone through 4 bottles and just ordered 2 more. at $17.99 the price is about 6 more than I'd like to pay.<br /><br />Overall a great product, about 1/3 overpriced, but if your looking a sauce you can enjoy and get some nice lasting heat out of this is the one.",340055,4

Well, actually a few did but it was with disgust and only long enough to drag them away from their bowl or bed and deposit elsewhere. Seriously; my dogs run now when they see one. They think it's a snake or something I guess. So if you have a dog like most us humans that like most of us have one that doesn't take too well to animal ears unless they are warm & running then do not waste your money on these.",404498,1

"Okay, when you try to go gluten or wheat free there are many things that you miss.  A nice fresh loaf of bread happens to be number one, but a close second is a wonderful pan of moist brownies.  The sad thing is that many gluten-free mixes end up with products that are coarse and dry...and, believe me, I've tried many.<br /><br />This one, however, is fabulous.  You'd never know it was gluten free.  In fact, if you make it for people who aren't going gluten free, they'll never know.  But why do that?  They can have their regular old brownies and you can have these...all for yourself.<br /><br />Easy to make.  Moist.  Nice texture.  They don't even need frosting.  Just sprinkle some powdered sugar on top if you like (if you sprinkle it through a doily it will make a pattern for fancy events).  I've also added nuts to this mix, such as almonds, walnuts, and even brazil nuts.<br /><br />Simply heaven.",14698,5
"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real """"premium"""" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real """"premium"""" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real """"premium"""" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!",351136,1
"I got hooked on Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee when we purchased a variety pack and this flavor was included.  It is such a rich, creamy, medium roast coffee.

"This vanilla coffee is just what one would expect from Starbucks. Excellent. Though I have to admit, I'd still rather have a cup brewed by Starbucks themselves delivered to my door all hot and ready to sip.<br /><br />PS: Love that Starbucks keeps to their message of """"responsibly grown, ethically traded.""""  It's worth a little extra money to me to have that satisfaction in addition to good taste.",133286,5

I submitted a review on packaging with a photo of the 9 cans, thinking I would hear back promptly from someone at Amazon or at Amy's company, but so far nothing.  I was not able to find another way to communicate, so perhaps this will get a reply.  The outer carton was perfect and the shipment included a book which was also undamaged.  The 12 cans had been shrink-wrapped on a tray and were o.k. to look at until you unwrapped them.  I don't know how 9 of the 12 could be so badly dented without anyone being aware.  I will be happy to e-mail a photo if someone will give me instructions.  Thanks!",181548,1
"From my wife Sarah: I enjoy the sweet cinnamon flavor and crunchy texture, and this product is great if you're:<br /><br />1. ON A DIET - I love the 1 ounce packs. They're portable and only 110 calories which is great for a snack or meal replacement if you're keeping low calories and you're out of the house. I find that by the end of the bag I'm very satisfied.<br /><br />2. LOOKING FOR A LOW CARB TREAT - I carry protein bars too, but these have crunch and it's oh so satisfying as a treat. They have a pleasant sweet flavor, and they feed my munch cravings. They only contain 15 carbs but when you subtract the 3 fiber grams that's 12 carbs, which for me is reasonable.<br /><br />3. EATING GLUTEN FREE - Speaks for itself!<br /><br />4. ON A LOW SUGAR DIET - Only 3 grams of sugar, and they don't contain the sweeteners that cause a laxative effect.<br /><br />5. NEEDING PROTEIN - 10 grams of protein makes this product a good pick-me-up.<br /><br />I recommend this product, and I think Amazon has a reasonable price - better than what they charge locally and on some other sites I saw. I have Amazon Prime so I don't pay additional shipping, so that helps keep it reasonable.",129135,5
"My husband is diabetic and to find this product once in a store was great. He enjoyed it so much that we tried to find it again. That seemed to be impossible.

"My three year old son loves this and drinks about three glasses a day.<br />We both have malnourishment issues so I try to make sure any food we eat<br />is as healthy as possible. This drink mix has made it possible for my son<br />to not need supplement in a pill form. It does not taste like Hershey syrup,<br />but my son doesn't mind because he has never had Hershey syrup. It is hard to dissolve in cold milk so I mix it with warm water first then add the dissolved """"syrup"""" into the milk. I make it in a shaker cup and I make enough for at least one day and that works well. Oh and once it's open it needs to be kept in the refrigerator. You can buy it at Whole Foods and some Vitamin stores but it's cheaper on Amazon. We have been using this for about two years.",64802,5

"We just got the Great Northern Princeton popper a few weeks ago and also sent a 24 count prepackaged case of the Great Northern 8oz pop corn. The kids (11 and 6) really love it... They actually do the popping themselves. I have just ordered the auto buy/shipping option for having them delivered every 3 months. Got a 15% discount to do it and makes it really convenient and saved a bit also. The kids have raved about the popcorn and the popper also,,,so its been a rally good deal for us. This popcorn is very healthy for the kids (Check out the actual info about the product with Coconut oil). If there are any problems in the future I will amend this rating.

She mentioned that her cat didn't care for the salmon in it, however, the concept of the food is excellent. Well, yes, I agree, although, I would have given this excellent cat food the highest rating. My cats, all 5 of them, love all the flavors of this brand.

"Got absolutely nothing from it.  It did taste decent, not worth $2.50 for the bottle, but at least it didn't taste like crap AND do nothing.<br /><br />This comment will probably get pushed down quickly; It looks like whoever is selling this product does the thing where whenever a somewhat negative review appears, they quickly create some accounts and give this a 5 star rating and vote helpful for all of the other previous fake 5-star comments.  The way you can usually tell is go threw and click the link that says """"see all my reviews"""" by the 5 star comments; on many of them you will see this is the only product they have ever rated.

"During my last trip to our local grocery store, I picked up a Maruchan Yakisoba Noodle Bowl (sweet and sour chicken flavor) just out of curiosity, and I had it for a light lunch today. It was quite good and took only four minutes to prepare. The sweet and sour taste was very good. It was too high in sodium, of course, which is typical of these prepared bowls. Probably half the packet of flavoring is salt. So, I watch my salt intake for the rest of the day when I have one of these. On the other hand, it had 6 grams of protein, which was high for a dish like this. All in all, it made a good, but not a great, lunch.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",522017,4

I like that I can control the consistency by varying the amount of water and powder I use. There are times when a thicker mustard is called for, so I am able to adjust the proportions accordingly. The quality of this product has remained consistently high in my opinion. If kept in the fridge, Colman's Mustard powder seems to last indefinitely without losing its punch.

"I do not find this tea to be overly sweet and I take it hot or cold without any sweetener. I prefer it hot I find, but have tried it iced and found it to be quite pleasant.  This tea has a lightly fruity taste.  There are many ingredients, which I have found to be true of all of Stash's herbal teas.  To fear the ingredients, they are all top quality and marry well.  I wondered what """"goji berry flavor"""" was and contacted the company.  Here is a transcript:<br /><br />Email reply from Stash when asked about goji berry flavor:<br /><br />Unfortunately it's proprietary information with our suppliers; however we do require natural statements from our suppliers. We use the Code of Federal Regulations as far as our definition of natural<br /><br />According to the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), the term natural flavor means """"the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive,  protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juices, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible years, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in t food is flavoring rather than nutritional.""""<br /><br />There you have it, essential oil of goji berry.

Happily I can say this experience went well. I received all 6 boxes, intact, and promptly. The expiration dates are surly nothing for me to worry about the dates are well over the amount of time to take me to eat them. This flavor is very good and I believe it is not a sweet as Quaker Oats brand. Being that they are less sweet and organic is a plus for me and exactly what I was looking for. There is a good amount of raisins and it tastes splendid with water added. Usually I add milk to enrich the taste, but I find there is no need with this brand.<br /><br />The price is good too.

"I love the taste of this coffee.  But apparently they have poor quality control.  These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly.  You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to.  Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem.<br /><br />It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.<br /><br />I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing.",489967,3

"In my culture we cook with coconut milk all the time. Usually I use chaokoh brand but I was at whole foods and happened to buy thai kitchen brand organic coconut milk. Why they even make organic coconut milk I will never know. The husk and shell on a coconut are thick enough to protect the nut from pesticides. though I don't know about commercial coconut growing I do know that coconut palms grow everywhere around my family's home and there's no need for pesticides; the nuts are protected by nature. Anyways, I'm glad I didn't buy a whole case of the stuff. I tasted it before I added it to the eggplant dish I was making and it was gross and watery. Real coconut milk, like chaokoh, has the slightest sweetness to it and is thick, creamy and separated. I was in a pinch so I went ahead and used it, but I feel my dish would have been better if I used my usual brand.",446372,1

The dark flavor comes alive this way in my opinion.  The espresso shot is good, but I have tasted better.  Drip coffee is okay, but Americano works better.

"As my Lab has now reached what is considered to be the adult senior age, I wanted to find a new healthier dry kibble commensurate with his age.  The new kibble had to be one that wouldn't add excess weight due to a bit of slowing down in his activity i.e., he now becomes tired after a three mile walk instead of a heretofore 4-5 mile jaunt, he's not quite so ball-chasing crazy as before and his swims in the pool are not quite as often.  He also seems more prone to the seasonal allergies such as mountain cedar that also gives his human companion fits.  For his allergies I do have a vet prescribed shampoo that significantly reduces the middle of the night floor thumping waking up human companion from a deep sleep scratching times!  Plus he gets an allergy injection when the allergy gets really bad.<br /><br />I first tried a small bag of this kibble mixing it in at the vet reccommended ratio, e.g., 3 parts of the dry kibble I had been using to 1 part Blue Buffalo (hereafter referred to as BB) in order to properly aquaint his digestive system to the new kibble.  I noticed right away that he seemed to like the BB add in.  As the ratio changed, I noticed he was really tail wagging while munching.  As the ratio progressed to the now 3 parts BB to 1 part other kibble ratio, I noticed he tended to nose around the other kibble seemingly preferring the BB. I've also noticed his (winter) coat has a bit more shine to it, pet dander is less noticible, the above middle of the night scratching has become even less frequent and he has dropped a few pounds as well. Next week begins 100% BB and it appears my boy will be perfectly happy with only the BB kibble in his bowl.<br /><br />I have also switched to a number of other BB products including their chew bones and some dry treats. My Lab loves them all and seems to look forward to treat time even more (if that's possible).<br /><br />Unless something drastic happens to change my mind, I will be sticking to this BB dry kibble product notwithstanding it tends to be a bit pricey.  The ingredients appear to be some of the healthiest available in pet food and treats, there doesn't appear to be any animal by-product fillers or unhealthy for pets grains, it hasn't caused any weight gain and doesn't seem to further irritate his allergies.  Yes, according to the Vet, the type and kind of food/treats you feed your pet can both cause or irritate (existing) allergies.  I took my Lab to raise and love and wouldn't think of giving him food or treats that contain ingredients that are unhealthy or even harmful to his health.  Plus, BB products are made right here in the U.S.A.<br /><br />I will NEVER EVER buy any pet food product that is made in CHINA!  Pet owners, PLEASE, read the label before you buy your pet foods and treats.  If it indicates it is made in China, PLEASE don't buy it.  It is a well known, documented and published fact that thousands of pets have already been sickened or died from eating pet food/treat products made in China where everything from cheap fillers such as melamine powder (the same ingredient they make melamine dinnerware from!) to diseased, rotting meat flesh, dead animals still in plastic bags are all tossed into the mix.  There is little to no quality control in China.  The goal is to make cheap, ship it off to the U.S. where it is sold by distributors for a high price and profit.  Given the thousands of both human and pet consumable food products that hit U.S. shores on a daily basis, the FDA, with their ever shrinking inspector cadre thanks to Washington's budget cuts, can do only so much to catch tainted human and/or pet food products once they reach the U.S.<br /><br />Shame on all the U.S. companies who buy China made pet food products for distribution in the U.S. in the first place and then hype them up to pet owners via cutesy advertising all the while being careful to not disclose the fact in said advertising that the product was made in China. If that fact was made known up front, given historical data on China made pet food products, doubt sales would be very good.  It is overtly obvious the only concern of the distributors is to make a fast greedy buck; never mind the fact that feeding these China made products can result in serious illness to or even the death of a pet.<br /><br />In the event any negative changes occur as a result of long term feeding of this dry kibble brand, I will immediately update this review.",354976,5

"I tried this product because I like the taste of passion fruit and because of the health benefits associated with aloe vera and green tea.  The aloe vera pulp is fresh and even somewhat crunchy yet entirely drinkable.  The ingredients list reveals that there is very little to this drink - basically water, green tea, a non-HFCS sweetener, aloe vera, passion fruit flavor and some citric acid.<br /><br />I was less enticed by the combination of green tea and aloe as I was by the combination of passion fruit and aloe.  I like to drink Alo Exposed Aloe Vera Drink, and the consistency of the aloe in this drink is similar.  The added flavor of passion fruit makes this tea more enjoyable.  The flavor is somewhat floral.  I am not bothered by the aloe chunks, and I find this tea quite refreshing.  However, if you are the type that is bothered by pulpy type drinks, this may not appeal to you.  Would I order it again?  Yes.",135991,4

"When I bought this roll, I have to admit I was very skeptical. I have a smalandsstovare and a very finicky german shepherd, and she hates everything. I've had a very difficult time getting her to eat any dry dog food, and I've tried them all. I bought this along with our first bag of Natural Balance lamb and rice dry food, and the results have astounded me!  She ate the dry food immediately, and ate every bite, as did Tidas. An hour later, I decided to give the roll a try as a treat. The second I sliced into the roll, both dogs were pacing the kitchen. They ate it like I had just given them prime rib! I'm a new customer, and I will be a lifelong customer. The food smells good, the roll smells better than some of the summer sausage rolls I've bought at the holidays for people, and its an allergy formula. Win, win, win. If you have a fussy eater, or a dog with skin allergies, I strongly encourage you to give this a try.",328777,5
"""""Dave's Insanity Sauce"""" is not to be taken casually or even as a way to add heat to individual servings, this is meant for larger dishes such as a whole pot of chili or a big batch of salsa since one or two drops will make a large amount of food VERY hot. That being said, this does have a really good flavor that adds a nice pepper tangy hit that complements most Mexican or South-Western dishes, but I wouldn't use it in Indian or Chinese style dishes.<br /><br />There are several amusing and somewhat painful to watch videos of people abusing this sauce on various web sites and a quick search will provide you with a lot of hits.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH",146315,5

"I must say this is easily my favorite of the Kitchens of India [KoI], Ready to Eat curries that they offer.  The Pindi Chana, chick pea curry takes virtually no time to make.  Either empty the pouch into a pan and heat for 3 minutes; microwave the contents in a bowl (I prefer mine over rice), or just heat the package up in boiling water for about 3-5 minutes dig in without needing a container.  It is an easy, fast meal that tastes delicious!<br /><br />Speaking of taste, the Pindi Chana comes across as a flavorful curry that seems so simple yet can be very complex.  There is a mild ginger flavor to this curry that goes really well with the chick peas and potatoes inside.  The spices are perfectly balanced and do not overpower the flavor of the chick peas, while having a slight spicy after taste.  There is a lot going on with this curry but it comes together really well to produce an outstanding dish that is ready for you in less than 5 minutes!<br /><br />I would gladly give this curry 5 stars in a heart beat but what brings this curry down to 4 stars is actually the Salt and Fat content.  While this curry doesn't taste very salty at all(probably because I eat it over rice), it packs about 830mg per serving of salt and 10g of Fat.  10oz of this delicious curry will cost you over 20g of fat and almost 2 grams of salt; plus around 500 calories just for the entire packet alone (not including any sides).  Of course this delicious curry is worth it, but I personally portion the packet out usually into 2 servings.  For the price you get two fast meals that taste excellent.<br /><br />5 star quality taste, but overall 4 stars due to less than stellar nutritional value....<br /><br />* Nutritional Information ** (Entire packet)<br />Each packet is 10oz (285g) and contains a little less than THREE Servings (~2.5 servings).

"i still worry about the rumored threat to dogs from these treats, but they have changed the formula so i am assuming all is well with them.  and i am assuming since they are front and center in most pet places that they are safe.  and my italian greyhound is obsessed with them.  they make her (usually hideous) breath smell fresh and clean and have really made a difference in the cleanliness of her teeth.  i always make sure to watch her while she's eating it, not only for her safety, but because it is freaking adorable to watch her chew on it.  just a tip, these are cheaper from entirelypets from amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Greenies-Dental-Chews-ounce-Teenie/dp/B001CWEC2W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1266273814&sr=8-1",74733,5

I would have used regular pasta, but the nuttier flavor of wheat pasta was better for this particular recipe.

I understand about """"not overcooking.""""  But this stuff was something else.  I tested frequently and yet the line between undercooked and gummy/overcooked is very very fine.<br /><br />I tried to eat a plate of dinner, but it was nasty.

"I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?",308887,4
"We have a two spoiled dogs who really enjoy their treats.  While they are somewhat like pigs when it comes to their extra dietary choices, they have been known to show greater enthusiasm for some.  We have also found that so many of these treats on the market are unhealthy and mostly comprised of fillers and junk.  We decided to try the Newman's Own because it was organic (which we like for ourselves so we thought it would also be good for our treasured pets), and it looked like it was a total package healthy choice treat.  We have also used other Newman's Own products for our personal food selections and have never been disappointed.  These treats quickly became the favorite choice for our dogs.  Our English Setter began salavating as soon as we opened the package.  If these don't make your dogs wag their tails in appreciation nothing will.  I have even thought of trying one myself, but whenever I open the package the dogs come running and since I don't allow them to eat my treats I would feel bad to eat theirs.",14252,5

I think they are rather bland, and because they are coarsely ground there are hard bits of stuff in them, one of which got caught between my teeth. I think they could have used a little bit more salt.

"Overall, I think this is a good food and an absolutely amazing value as far as grain-free foods go.  My cat certainly enjoyed it, I saw an improvement in her fur, and she became leaner and more active.  On her prior diet of Science Diet Light (high carb, filler food - shame on me!) she was becoming fat and lethargic.  The difference in feeding a grain-free, high protein food was almost immediate.<br /><br />My only problem with Taste of the Wild is that the amount of vegetables after the first ingredient (chicken meal) seems excessive.  Too many pea proteins and potato proteins.  The next meat ingredients, venison and salmon, don't appear until the sixth and seventh ingredient.  Recently I decided to switch my cat to Orijen, which I believe is the very best dry cat food out there - the first 6 ingredients are all meats!  Orijen, however, is also significantly more expensive.  For those who are on a budget, I think Taste of the Wild is far better than the vast majority of commercial dry kibbles out there.  Taste of the Wild is certainly better than the by-product and corn filler loaded (not to mention expensive) Science Diet that I fed my cat for the first 3 years of her life.",152681,4
"I have to say this is an unusual product.  It's made on the same order as a deodorant and the dog licks the roller to get the flavoring.  We got the liver flavor and all the dogs loved it.  In fact, there was some times when two dogs were trying to lick the roller at the same time since they can't seem to wait their turn.  It's definitely something to try...don't know how well it would do training your dog instead of the regular treats, though.  It'll probably get gross after a few lickings too but a damp paper towel should fix it up...especially if you wipe it after the dog uses it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't comment if it really tastes like liver flavor.

They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't. Interestingly enough the aftertaste is actually better than the intial flavor of the chip itself.<br />I'm not saying this flavor is bad, it's just not that good.<br /><br />Overall, great brand with great flavors in general but Chili Lime doesn't stack up against the others.",359505,3

For the chicken, I toss the chicken breasts into a bowl with the sauce. Tenderize the breasts a bit with a fork so the sauce can get into the breasts, also. Toss on the grill with a bit more sauce, and serve. For the venison, I simply browned the venison, added the sauce, and cooked until not quite med/rare.

Delicious!!!",23267,5
"As another reviewer said, these salted caramels are full of unpleasant ingredients such as coconut oil, making them unhealthy. If you're going for healthy, caramel isn't your best bet anyway,  but traditional ingredients would be better. Not only that, but these taste processed, and have an unpleasant mouth feel.<br /><br /> I have tasted Bequet salted caramel; it's soft and chewy with well developed (and yummy) traditional buttery flavor. The sea salt is in discrete peices, crunching slightly when you chew or blooming on your tongue. By contrast, the Carosel caramels  taste like someone boiled up vanilla coffee creamer and stirred in some normal table salt.<br /><br />GAH! Do yourself a favor and go for the Bequet.<br /><br />.<a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00376ZEY6"""">Bequet Gourmet Celtic Sea Salt Caramel - 8 oz bag</a>",134159,1

"We purchased this in addition to the Red Vines Black Licorice Twists.<br /><br />Red Vines provide excellent value; you will not find four pounds of candy at this price that is so popular with kids and adults. Red Vines are Star-K kosher-certified with no fat and only 140 calories per serving (five pieces/vines).<br /><br />The licorice is also versatile for many occasions. I use Red Vines licorice for Halloween, birthday parties and I keep a tub at the office to fend off co-workers who roam around in the afternoon, looking for a snack.<br /><br />Licorice requires tender, loving care. Unlike hard candy, which can (and often does) sit for months in the bottom of your grandmother's purse, licorice tastes best soft and fresh. Storage should be airtight and at room temperature. Lucky for us, this order arrives in a plastic tub with a nine-month shelf life.<br /><br />According to the Red Vines web site, """"many fans heat Red Vines candy in their microwaves for 5-7 seconds or until the candy reaches the desired softness."""" I tried this trick and it works great, softening the licorice into a delectable treat.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.",172172,5

"The school where I work has a """"popcorn day"""" one Friday per month.  The popcorn is popped in a theater-type popper.  They use the Act II Buttery flavored oil and the Act II butter flavored salt.  I don't know how others who gave such poor reviews are popping their corn, but our popcorn is fabulous!  It is a huge hit at school, both with the kids and the adult staff.  We have families who buy enough for every member of the family for a movie and popcorn night.  Maybe others are not measuring it correctly, or are not using the right popper.  I don't know.  All I can say is I love this stuff!!  I smell it being popped all day and can't wait to eat it!!  It takes all my willpower to keep from eating a bag of it for lunch!<br /><br />If you use the Act II salt with the oil, be careful not to use too much of the salt.  It seems to be concentrated.

"My dog, who has a sensitive stomach, tolerates this product well and really likes it.  In consistency it is like soft pepperoni sausage, which makes it more convenient to handle than canned food under some circumstances.  For example, I can cut a slice of it and send it with my dog to dog care in a plastic bag, whereas sending canned food can be a problem if I want to give him a portion less than a whole can.<br /><br />The roll is shelf stable for a period of time, but once opened must be refrigerated, and if you are not going to use it for a while, should be frozen.  This is a large roll which will take up space in the fridge.  I put a plastic grocery bag over the open end and held it on with rubber bands.<br /><br />Three stars because of the ingredients.  The ingredients are listed differently on the roll than they are on this or any other website that I've found.  The first three listed ingredients are: lamb lungs, wheat flour, and sugar.  Many dogs are allergic to wheat, so this is not a great choice; and I can't imagine why there should be sugar in anything claiming to be a dog food.  Maybe in a dog treat.",328762,3

I first tried it because I make my own espresso drinks at home and was looking for a good,rich espresso coffee without the ridiculous price. My objective as always was to save money, yet get a good product at the same time. I bought this at the store that I most frequent for $3.45 for a 10oz can. I was pleased with the flavor, and the price. I have used this ever since.I have also used in it my regular coffee maker and it makes a great cup of regular java for those that don't want all the foo foo in their coffee. However lately I have noticed that at the place I shop known for """" Always low prices"""" that they have slowly raised prices, not by much but it got me to thinking I wonder if I can find it for cheaper here on my favorite ( tonque in cheek) website. Well lo and behold, I found at a good price for 4 10oz. bricks of my favorite espresso coffee, with Prime free 2 day shipping.

They actually tasted dusty and I could feel no potency in them at all.<br />2) Wolfberries not Goji Berries.  Since I've consumed Goji's from many sources over the years, I know which are the highest quality Goji's (usually quite expensive), which are less potent, and which are the different tasting Wolfberry variety that many sellers pass off as Goji's but are not the same.  Wolfberry has its own benefits (not nearly those of Goji IMO), but for Wolfberries these are widly overpriced.  You can get the same in Chinese stores for probably closer to $10 for twice the amount.<br /><br />With the dollar devaluation top quality Goji berries have gotten very expensive for regular use.  So if you're looking for cheaper alternatives like I was here, look elsewhere.  Check out some of the cheap goji berries (that are in fact wolfberries and usually say so) on Ebay from Chinese sources.  They'll be quite a bit cheaper and likely quite a bit fresher.",113831,1

"First off, with a name like """"vanilla blueberry clusters"""" you'd think there'd be some dried blueberries mixed in with the granola, but you'd be wrong here.  It's simply pureed blueberries mixed in with the other flavorings.  I also have to take a little issue with the """"clusters"""" part of the name.  Some of the product was in clusters, a bit was in great chunks, but a lot of it is broken down into little pieces or partial pieces of grain and seeds (and those flax seeds are tiny!).  Some of that breakdown may be the way Amazon sent the Vine product sample to me, in a padded mailer, where normally I imagine they'd use a box, but I doubt that was the sole reason.<br /><br />My gluten-free friend liked this product enough to seek it out on her own.  My roommate's toddler enjoyed it and kept asking for more.  I am personally kind of ambivalent about it - I wanted a stronger blueberry presence and more clusters.  I'd eat it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it (unless shopping for gluten-free snacks for a social event with that friend).

"Growing up on Oreos and milk is common. So I was taken aback with the brand extension of Oreo's to cakesters. And while I had low expectations, I must say these are better than normal Oreos.

If you like cake and like Oreos you can't go wrong with Oreo cakesters.<br /><br />The filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience.

"I love this blend of tea--I've been drinking it since it came on the market (back in the old days when the packages were psychedelic and quirky, and Red Zinger had almost 20 different herbal ingredients--now sadly reduced to a much less complex blend.) However, Sleepytime may have changed its package but the blend is the same--lime blossom (linden flowers or tilia, same thing), chamomile and spearmint. This is a brilliant mix, the linden and chamomile floral, sweet and soporific, the spearmint adding just enough of a hit to make it interesting. It's good as an after-dinner digestif, or as a before-bed soothing drink.<br /><br />Each ingredient has a purpose; linden is a relaxer and is said to restore the liver (hence, it's used as a tisane in France, where livers are always suspected of being upset), chamomile is a tension-tamer and soothes the stomach, and spearmint is a digestive (unless you have GERD--mints can be irritating, sad to say.) After a heavy meal, this tea can soothe a stomach. As a before-bed potion, it's unparalleled. I drink this almost every evening. You can serve it to children with a bit of milk and sugar to make """"cambric tea"""" which is an old recipe for a posset to serve to children, too young for caffeine. (Cambric is a white, sheer fabric, so """"cambric tea"""" is white and thin, no color.)<br /><br />You actually don't need to have K-cups--just brew a cup of hot water from the Keurig and dip in a Sleepytime tea bag. But if you are serving guests at table or in your office, a dripping tea bag is a nuisance and I for one am not a person who drinks her tea with the bag sitting in the mug. I just can't do it, though I know many people do. Call me a fussbudget but I don't like sipping past a steeping bag. The K-Cup makes a perfectly steeped cup immediately and no messy bag to clean up. So if you drink this on the way to work in a travel mug or don't want to deal with a tea bag, the K-Cup is very  nice indeed.",47736,5

When I heard about Walden Farms calorie free peanut butter I was highly skeptical but decided to give it a try.  I have to say, that this product was probably THE worst tasting diet food I have ever eaten.  I am a huge fan of peanut butter, and thought maybe this would slightly resemble it, but the taste was nowhere close.  This product SERIOUSLY offended me.  I would give it to a homeless person, but I'm not that cruel.  If you're looking for peanut butter substitutes I'd recommend PB2.  It contains only peanuts and salt, and actually tastes like peanuts.<br /><br />Walden Farms DOES have good products, though.

The bars come in at 180 calories, which is just about right for a snack that also delivers protein, but maybe on the high end of snack portions for those watching calories.

Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar.<br /><br />At only 130 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, and 7 grams of sugar (natural fruit sugar), the Nana Banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults.  The amount of banana is just right, and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside.<br /><br />Each cookie measures approximately 3.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide...perfect for a light snack or dessert, especially for kids.

"I ordered these noodles after reading stellar reviews.  Some folks in the reviews almost acted as if these noodles were sent from God.  I've eaten Ramen Noodles for quite some time and have found them to be a super inexpensive meal at .10 a package and sometimes cheaper.  I also like other readers mentioned don't always use the entire seasoning packet because of the high sodium content.  I found these noodles to have even higher sodium content.  Which I guess isn't too bad if you don't plan on eating the soup.<br />These noodles to me tasted just about the same as Ramen Noodles except the noodles were a tid bit larger in size.  If we are reviewing just the flavor packet, I would say it was pretty good.  Especially for those who like spice like myself.  I am use to eating super spicy foods and have a high tolerance to spice.  So they were right on par with what I am use to as far as the heat goes.  But I can see someone who doesn't eat spicy foods to find the seasoning super hot and spicy for them.  I like the idea of the dehydrated veggies that are enclosed to accompany the seasoning.  I am giving these noodles 3 stars because they are just overpriced Ramen in my opinion.  Plus the sodium content in the noodles is just unacceptable.  They surely can come up with lower sodium options. And lastly I give it 3 stars because of the price.  I would not expect to pay more than .50 cents a package for these noodles in a retail store.

He really enjoys focusing on this task for the 10 mins, as the JRT is an obsessive breed anyhow.  It gives him a good job to work on.  I recommend this simple toy as we have seen good results and it performs exactly as advertised.  Durability is good, our guy is tough on toys, but if you give it to him with food in it and then remove it from him when complete, there are no issues.",235020,4
"I love the taste and texture of this pasta (as long as you pay attention to cooking instructions mentioned in the other reviews).<br />HOWEVER, I always experience joint pain after eating it. I can eat quinoa with no problems, so my problem must be with the corn. Since my reaction is no where near as severe as with wheat, I do eat this on occasion.<br /><br />So, my """"caution"""" is that you listen to YOUR body, and if you notice any unpleasant effects, just don't eat this very often.<br /><br />btw... if you are testing yourself for gluten sensitivity, it's best to go off ALL grains for at least a month (really, it won't kill you!).  Then, add some of the less offensive ones, such as quinoa, back into your diet, one at a time. Note how you feel the next day.  Then, use common sense, and don't eat the ones that cause you pain or discomfort.",350899,4

"Camano Island Coffee Roasters corrected the packaging problem, so my coffee arrived with a good aroma and oils on the bean. Colombian coffee is typically a bright slightly-nutty brew. Since Central and South American coffees are """"washed,"""" - these regions have plenty of water - taking the coffee fruit away creates a bright brew in the cup as it ferments on the cement patios. This coffee met with my expectations of a great Colombian coffee with a slightly-nutty clean taste.  The richness was outstanding, with a pleasing mouth feel and clean finish.",141608,4

"My dogs are obsessed with these.  First I bought the wrong ball - don't be confused with the treat ball where you put small treats inside.  I nearly died when I realized that i needed to buy TWO balls that were more than TWENTY DOLLARS EACH!!  (thinking: """"these had BETTER be good"""")<br /><br />My dogs are 11 lbs each and I got the medium ball.  I think that's the right size.  I gave them each a ball with a treat in both sides.  After two days gone to work (22hrs in total) they've eaten the treats.  So I have to spend at LEAST $7 per dog to utilize these balls for 2 days out of the week.<br /><br />Hmmm...this is like a smoking addiction or something.<br /><br />If you need for shorter periods of time; i.e. while you watch a movie, dinner, gone for  coupla hours, GREAT toy.  I do have to be careful because my two dogs will fight over one ball when another is sitting a few feet away.  I guess they REALLY like them.<br /><br />Good luck.",561609,3

I can't believe I am raving about.. water!<br />When I got this bottle I read the bottle """"hmm 9.5 ph.? reverse osmosis? electrolytes? yeah ..whatever"""" and popped it into the fridge<br />I had some yesterday after cutting the lawn and said """"hmm this water tastes.... good?""""<br />It had some kind of I dunno.. taste to it; anyway, I liked it and  that was that.<br /><br />Well today I had to pack 2500 markers.. basically 50 bundles weighing 50 pounds each, in the lovely NJ humid air.<br />I open this stuff.. and WHOA... this is freaking good water!

"I was utterly excited when I saw this item and it certainly did not disappoint. It's not too sweet and the the mint undertones were perfect. The chocolate taste was also not overpowering, but you could certainly taste it.<br /><br />I added around 4 teaspoons to a cup of heated soymilk that I had heated in the microwave. It was delicious and I personally think that the soymilk helps compliments the flavors. I haven't tried regular milk since we don't usually have that in our fridge.<br /><br />I also attempted to mix this with milo, with soymilk of course. Two teaspoons of milo and two of this product had a richer chocolate taste, but the peppermint taste was still there. I prefer this one versus just the 4 teaspoons of peppermint mocha latte.<br /><br />Oh and did I mention the wonderful foam? It's absolutely splendid and it doesn't disappear after a few minutes.<br /><br />I have yet to add this to coffee, but I definitely plan to once I start drinking coffee again. I'm sure that a teaspoon or two will help brighten my day up in the morning.<br /><br />As for the cost, it's on the pricier side for me, especially since one 7.1 oz can doesn't seem to last a long time if you only use this mixed with water/milk. With 4 teaspoons per cup, I can maybe manage about 10 cups. It has a much higher value if you simply mix a teaspoon or two to hot chocolate or coffee since I can still get the same flavor, but enhanced with the taste of coffee or more chocolate. I might pick this up at my local store, but I can't see myself buying 4 cans of this at this price. While it can go a long way, I'd rather buy one can to last me during the holidays.",194642,4

We received a quick response from L.Phillips Brown, DVM, confirmed that even though they are not Organic chickens, they do NOT feed these free-range chickens GMO grains.<br /><br />We recently learned that since the mid-90s, food companies have been slipping GMOs into human and animal food, without our knowledge or approval, even though studies say these are quite harmful (causing damage to internal organs). The Europeans are smart enough to ban GMOs but not us """"dumb Americans"""". So unless it is organic you are best to avoid all non-Organic meat, poultry, and """"farm raised"""" fish (they are all fed GMOs) and non-Organic corn, soy, cottonseed, Canola products (these are GMO).<br /><br />Perhaps this cat food stopped the vomiting issue because Newman's Own has no GMOs or perhaps it is because there are no grains. In either event, it works. And this is nothing short of a miracle! We are astonished that the change was so immediate.<br /><br />All three cats love this food.

"I am an enabler.  My two dogs have an insatiable addiction to Greenies.  Every night around 8:45 p.m., they start whining, barking, and circling me... and they don't stop until they each get a Greenie for the day.  If you're a consistent buyer of Greenies like me, you know that it can get very expensive-- at the local chain pet store I can expect to pay $17.99 per bag of Greenies (12 oz., 43 teenie pieces).<br /><br />Which leads me to review Amazon's performance in delivering these doggie treats at a reasonable price; currently it's $15.99 per bag and if you buy 3 bag you get one for free.  In addition to this, there's free shipping which saves me time and a needless trip down to the pet store.  If you buy 4 bags, you're getting it for about $12 per bag, which is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />In terms of the snacks themselves, the senior version of these Teenie Greenies are great-- they taste just as great as the original (based on my dogs' ability to consume it in under 3 minutes) but they have a softer consistency.  One of my dogs is nearly 18 years old, while the other is 9 years old... so dental care and not stressing out their teeth is really important to me.<br /><br />As long as Amazon maintains this deal, I'll continue to purchase the item directly from them.",29754,5

Oh, how many times have I enjoyed an Oreo milkshake on a hot day, only to smile widely at everyone with a mess of chocolate cookie in my teeth?  *shudders*<br /><br />So, only downside to the Golden Oreos is that I don't think they'd be as good in a milkshake as regular Oreos.  But the pluses are many with the Golden Oreos... a crisp vanilla cookie that is very good all on its own, but sweet biscuits and gravy, the vanilla cookies are paired with a sweet filling.  They are addictive.<br /><br />If you like vanilla sandwich cookies, try the Golden Oreos!",535669,5
"It is quite different from what I purchased back in 2005. The biggest difference is in the size of cheese cubes. They used to be what is shown on the carton.  Ditto with gravy, it used to be quite thick. Looks like the efforts to reduce cost has taken a toll on this product too.",262087,1
"This cookie in the Oreo family is certainly tasty if not healthy. There is a layer of chocolate surrounding a peanut butter delight and what appears to be one original Oreo. This latest addition to the Oreo family is not as peanut-buttery as, for instance, a Reese's peanut butter cup; but it has a nice texture and flavor.  You don't have the two great chocolate cookie crusts and the filling as in the original Oreo that has delighted people forever, either with a glass of cold milk or in a pie crust or nestled inside a cheesecake so it is okay to like this one without forsaking your allegiance to what, as I recall, is the most popular cookie in the United States. It certainly has my vote, even above the best of chocolate-chip cookies.<br /><br />If you are avoiding fat and sugar, look someplace else as this little number is high in both.",169750,5
"Purchased at Costco.  I've been trying all sorts of coffee, all sorts of brewing methods, call it a quest. (Dunkin'Donuts brand coffee is so sour to me I need a donut's sweetness to offset!  Life is too short for that sort of thing.  Starbucks is a dang bitter cup...probably best as espresso.  Trader Joe's 100% Kona tastes like it was filtered through a dirt shirt!) Lately I've been using either french press or melitta paper pour-over.  Either way, San Francisco Bay by the Rogers Family Co. is some very, very good coffee.  It is a good french roast, chocolaty, low acidity and sugar/cream seems to mess up the wonderfully subtle flavor dance so I just drink it straight.  I've found very few competitors to this brand, especially in a bulk bag!",132590,5
"Chiavetta's is the absolute best """"brine"""" that you can buy.  The flavors after marinating overnight are fantastic.  However, you have to use a grill to cook the chicken in order to max out the flavor.  Make sure to shake the bottle well.<br /><br />This is only a 64oz bottle (not a gallon).  In addition, you can go to Chiavetta's and get a 6 pack of 32oz bottles for just a little more money.  I made the mistake of buying this one thinking it was a gallon (my fault for not using my head).  There are other Amazon listings that are also cheaper.",171494,5

"My son is deathly allergic to peanut butter, nuts/peanuts, so we had to sneak pbj's or not eat them at all for fear of his reaction. Then someone introduced us to Sunbutter. We tried it and immediately liked it and agreed that we needed to order some of this. Amazon had the best prices for a bulk order, so we bought online. I love the free super shipper, since we live in Alaska and would have to pay out the nose otherwise for shipping. Love it and will order more when we run out!",417432,5

"Have always enjoyed Balsen products. Found  the nuss-dessert cookies while on vacation at Sanibel Island Florida.

Wine snobs who think less of these kits should pay $100 plus for over priced kits and send their reviews to those companies. This is a fun hobby and should be looked at as such. Successes with these kits have given me the confidence to even try Welch's grape juice concentrate batches, but believe it or not, the Amazon kits are a lot cheaper to purchase than the concentrates (along with all the other components)at the store.

"I think I might be addicted !  This tea is so different, so tangy, it calls to me around 9 am when I am starting to drag and again later in the afternoon.  It is so zippy, unlike any tea I've had, its a real pick me up.  I love Stash teas and have been a fan for nearly 20 years, this one is a winner.",494278,5
"This item is not like any cookie I've ever met.  I am not sure what to call it.  It's large, 3 oz. and 300 calories.  It looks like a thick patty.  It is dense and chewy.  I bought the double chocolate chunk flavor.  It has a mild cocoa flavor with notes of prune and bitter coffee. It is only slightly sweet, and has a hint of medicinal quality.  Though listed in the ingredients, I could not find a single chocolate chunk that was large enough to differentiate from the rest of the heavy, soft patty.  Most of the doughy thing is chewable but there are small grains of something that are distinctly harder and got caught in the cusps of my molars.<br /><br />If you are too busy to enjoy your food or can't taste anything anyway, maybe these are for you.  For me, when I spend 300 calories, even on the run, I want something that makes my mouth happy.  Half a whole wheat English muffin, a tablespoon of natural peanut butter, half a banana sliced on top.  All around better! And no messier to eat because these patties are crumbly and a slightly sticky.  You'll have bits on your upholstry and traces on the steering wheel.<br /><br />Reformulate, Erin!  Food should be a healthy PLEASURE.",276610,1
"Love the laffy taffy.  But when I received this product, all of the protective plastic sealing was torn open (it actually looked torn open by a person as opposed to pressure breaking the seal).  Did not feel comfortable eating the product.  However, Amazon was great at quickly processing a refund.  I ended up buying the same product at the local Smart and Final for $4 less (around $9.00).  So the price of this product is much higher than it should be.",174627,1
"I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.",20400,1

"This Cinnamon Oat Cluster cereal looks like granola, but is dryer and lower in fat and calories than my favorite granola, Bear Naked All Natural Granola, Fruit and Nut, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6). In fact this whole grain cereal by Kind Healthy Grains has half the fat. So for everyday consumption, this cereal is quite tasty. Another characteristic of this cereal worth noting--the wholesome taste of the whole grain blend really comes through.<br /><br />I like to put cereal with fruit and yogurt. The nice this about this product is that it stays crunchy in milk or yogurt. So if crunch is something you like in your cereal, this one is a real keeper.",321259,5

"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional """"Gyokuro"""" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping.",533415,5

"I'm looking for a really good chai to make at home. This had good reviews and my local grocery store actually carried it. I brought it home, made a cup and literally couldn't drink it. I had to put 3 tsp the sugar in it and extra cream to even be able to take a few sips. And thats reslly saying domething because i usually take little to no sugar in my tea. I actually like bitter black tea. This chai by stash isn't bitter so much as just plsin bad. I love chai and used to order loose leaf ( at a high price) from a place online that doesn't have it anymore. I guess you get what you pay for. This tea has a terrible after taste i can't begin to describe. Like dirt or sour cinnamon. I like both cinnamon and cloves so i'm not sure my complaint is the same as other reviewers. It really tastes like old bitter, sour, cheap spices to me! Glad i got this on sale at the store rather than wasted money ordering here. This box willbe going to work, annonously so no one knows it's from me! Or perhaps i should just throw it out. Don't like to be wasteful but I can't bear the thought of drinking a whole box of this!",69634,1
"This coconut oil works wonders for my hair! I'm transitioning from using over the counter products with more natural alternatives and I truly am pleased. After about a month of using it as an overnight prepoo and after wash sealer I have noticed a change for the better in my hair. Coconut oil is the only oil that can penetrate into your hair follicles. My hair holds moisture a lot better than ever before, is stronger, shinier, smoother and softer. It makes a great hot oil treatment in tandem with amla oil. The smell isn't strong - it has a light nutty coco butter scent.<br /><br />Also, I found using this with shea butter liquifies it easier when rubbing your palms together. I've only used this product on my hair but I would love to try it with cooking.",367555,5
"My wife recently came back from the States, and she brought back a bunch of yummy treats including a bag of these jelly bird eggs.

My wife actually thinks these eggs for the birds. It should be noted that she doesn't care for super sweet desserts. I enjoy these guys so much that the sinner in me wants to hide in a corner and eat the whole bag in one sitting. I know that is wrong so I only eat a few at a time and share them with my daughters.

"I have two cats (male, 12 pounds & female, 7 pounds) and just switched from the Scoop Free (because I had to scoop constantly due to my cat's litter habits) to the Breeze.<br /><br />I love the Breeze because it is very easy, low maintenance, and has excellent odor control.  The only negative is the maintenance cost, but I figured out the usage for my household and it's virtually the same cost as the Scoop Free system.  It is not an economical system compared to scoopable litter, clay litter, or all natural litter alternatives.  You are paying for convenience and the neatness.  It's really mess-free and I never have to touch the pad, just dump the tray into the trash.<br /><br />I'm confused by some of the poor reviews because it really is a simple system.  Honestly, you'd have to be really drunk or half brain dead to screw it up.  It has to be used as a complete system.  It doesn't work if you try to not use the pads or take some other random cost-cutting measure.  I cannot figure out how the urine pan could leak at all if you are using the pad (right side up with the green plastic side down and the absorbant white side up) and you are changing it when it becomes full.  It functions like a diaper, once the absorbancy has been exhausted, that's it.  You get longer life/better absorbancy if you rotate the tray since cats tend to pee in the same area of the box every time.  If you have multiple cats and one box, or a large cat that pees a lot, you may need to change your pad more often, but that's specific to your cat.  If you are using the box properly with any amount of common sense applied, it will not leak.<br /><br />The bag of pellets is sparse, but that's because it is just supposed to let the urine pass through and give your cat a comfortable environment to allow burying.  The pellets are not meant to absorb the urine, or stick to the poop.  They do recommend that you completely change the pellets every month, so you don't really want to put in more than you need for your cat's comfort.  Both my cats are quite content with one pack.  There is no tracking with these pellets, I rarely find more than two or three pellets on the floor near the box.  I do not find that the pellets remove any odor from the solid waste.  I do notice an odor right after my cat has a bowel movement, or if the box is left longer than day without scooping out the solid waste.  I scoop daily into a litter locker and have no odor in the general areas of the box (unless there is something very fresh).  My pads last a full week, I do have to rotate them once. I have never smelt urine from this box.<br /><br />I do want to point out that because we have two cats and three levels of the house we did add additional boxes per the mfg recommendation (which I thought was crazy initially), however, it really did improve my cats' litter habits.  One cat was using alternative (and undesirable) areas to relieve herself (like my suitcase, laundry basket, etc.)  Once I put in multiple boxes, that behavior completely stopped.<br /><br />We have three boxes for the two cats, one at each level: basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor.  The pads generally last at least a week for all boxes, occasionally one box will be used less and a pad will last two weeks.  The pellets are still odor free after 6 weeks.  I agree that the refill costs are high, but as I said, comparable with the ScoopFree system, but this was actually cleaner and easier given the unique habits of my cats.  For me, the cost is worth the ease, convenience and general cleanliness of the system.",129555,4

Totally unpresentable. It appeared to me and to my wife (a master gardener) that the plant possibly had been subjected to freezing temperatures along with some rough handling. With dead blooms and brownish tone (lacking the rich green in the leaves) its future is very uncertain. I have a digital image of the plant as it looked upon arrival before it was to be transfered to the hospital and is available if a way to send. This is certainly not the quality I have come to expect of an Amazon product. Richard Wilson, Ph.D.",546167,1
"My husband loves Tangerine Orange Zinger tea, but it is hard to find.  I used to buy 2 to 4 boxes a week from a local grocery, but they decided not to carry it, and did not respond to my request to bring it back.  Other local stores charge $1.50 more per box, so I decided to look elsewhere.<br /><br />I found several places on the web that sell this tea, but I would have had to buy 24 boxes to get the price I wanted, AND pay shipping charges.  In the end Amazon offered the lowest price ($2.17/box), and no shipping cost when I bought $25+ worth of product.  That was only 12 boxes which may seem like a lot, but the tea is cellophane sealed, and won't go bad.  If you drink lots of tea buying from Amazon will likely be your best value.",303608,5
"I had been enduring an agonizing week-long episode of what appears to be a fibromyalgic Tetany Syndrome of excruciating pain radiating from hip-joint to knee-joint along the muscles between the joints. In trying to describe to myself the electro-convulsive nature of it, I said it appeared to be like a fibrillation - only deep in my hip, and immediately the word """"magnesium"""" popped into my mind. Dunno why.<br /><br />Tottered out to kitchen and One teaspoon of Natural Calm and 20 minutes later the convulsive constant spasms stopped. I was free from pain and able to sleep. Have had to keep a steady repeated dosage to keep the spasms at bay and it is difficult to admit that I probably have Fibromyalgia, but thank God for a remedy to the pain.<br /><br />I've kept the Natural Calm in my cupboard because of a peculiar muscle flutter/twitch I would get around the eyes when magnesium levels were low. Know this is just an anecdotal tale, but screaming pain one moment and no pain 20 minutes later, only difference being the magnesium is a tale that needs to be told.",257824,5

"Normally, my cats all love crunchy treats. I've seen them try to chew into the packs to get to the treats. I have 3 cats, a 13 year old male, a 1 year old male, and a 1 year old female.<br /><br />I gave them all some of these treats. The two males ate three pieces each and left the rest. Well, actually, the younger male tried to bury the ones that were left, making the same motions he does in the litter box. The female ate five pieces and then was done; she would not touch the others' leftovers.<br /><br />I have never in my life seen any cats walk away from treats like these. And since the recommended amount for teeth cleaning is 5 pieces twice a day, these obviously are not going to work even if the cats could be persuaded to try them again, if three is all they can stand.<br /><br />Looking at how the cats were chewing them, I might guess that these were _too_ crunchy for them to enjoy. But that wouldn't explain why the one cat thought the treats should be buried.",187962,1

The convenience of either adding it to a glass of cold water or to a bottle of water for on-the-go is nice. I prefer decaf teas during the day so this is perfect.

"Wonderful product. """"Instantly"""" puts all """"instant oatmeal"""" (except McCann's) products in the trash heap. It does take 30 minutes to cook, but following the directions on the can (4 cups water, 1 cup oats) this makes four breakfasts (just under 1 cup of cooked oats each) for me; it might make 5 for smaller appetites.<br /><br />I make it in the evening by starting with the water and oats, with just a touch of salt in the water. Stir the oats initially, then set a timer and leave it be on very low heat (just barely bubbling). At the end of 30 minutes, stir well, then I divide the oatmeal into 4 equal parts (usually just under 1 cup each) and put it into those little Glad Serv-n-Saver type containers (the """"Tupperware"""" you don't mind losing!). Into each container (""""bowl"""") I like to mix a handful of raisins (or other dried fruit, but raisins are my personal favorite), a dash or two of cinnamon, about a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of ground flax seed. I then mix each thoroughly and cover; then all 4 """"ready to heat and serve"""" bowls go into the fridge.<br /><br />Each morning, then, I pour about a tablespoon of skim or soy milk on top of the oatmeal, then microwave for 1min 20sec (your oven may vary, of course). Stir, and enjoy; I eat it right out of the Serv-n-Saver bowl, which cuts down on washing, too! It's a wonderful tasting, quick and HEALTHY part of your breakfast.

If you were to compare it to the calorie count per ounce with a soft drink like Sprite, it has a little less. For me, this is an acceptable substitute for my daughter instead of a soft drink.<br /><br />The packaging boasts of having no refined sugars and being fortified with vitamins (looks like vitamins C, B6 and Niacin)",545362,4

"Have loved Community Coffee since I first tried it at the Cafe Dumond in the French Quarter. I was online looking for the original blend with chicory, but couldn't find it available in a small enough batch, since I'm only one person and can't use ten bags of coffee.  I saw this flavor and decided to try it . . . it's delicious . . . rich and flavorful with no acidic undertones . . . even better with vanilla flavored creamer.  I'll buy it again.",269674,5
"I am so glad I bought these bars! They are absolutely delicious and a refreshing treat from all the other bars out there. I gave up on protein bars because I couldn't find one that tasted decent but these are really good. I've tried the peanut butter cream (awesome) and vanilla. Love the wafer taste.",509635,5

"Sparkling ICE Spring Water, Kiwi Strawberry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)  These come less than $1 a bottle to my door; no dragging them in a car and grocery cart!  My 21 year old daughter had the last bottle while working in a hot foundry and told me it was wonderful to drink this flavor during her break, so I ordered more today. All the Sparkling ICE I have bought taste delicious, but she likes this flavor the most. I think the bottle shape and size is perfect and hope that they do not try to improve anything.",261332,5
"This is a nice berry flavored tea, with some hints of other themes. It is pretty straightforward, definitely not a """"complex"""" tea. It tastes mainly of strawberry, but there are other flavors in there as well. Overall a great taste when you're looking for a fruity kick.<br /><br />Also note that this is a caffeine free herbal tea, so you can drink it whenever you want!",491603,5
"I could not live without Amazon.com any more.  I find there every single thing that I used to buy at overpriced stores, including this tea which I feel it helps me to control my appetite.  I used to buy a small box at Whole Foods for practically the same price I now pay for twice the amount.  Besides, the tea smells really fresh, not like the other one that was on the shelf who knows for how long.  Thank you Amazon.com, you make my life so much more easy!",348658,5
"I received this item with several other items - it was carefully packed in an individual, padded box within the larger parcel Amazon delivered.  While I prefer vanilla bean paste as a general rule, extract is much more economical and this is fairly good quality product with a standard alcohol base.  The value is hard to beat.",114924,5

The real benefit for me it that I'm insulin dependent diabetic so I'm very limited as to what I can consume without drug interactions.  And this product doesn't cause any interaction problems.  And there isn't any crash problems or sugar rushes that other products cause.  I'm back looking to by my 4th case of this product!  It's a great pick-me up when traveling or just feeling drained.  I never make a driving trip with out one in the car!",419606,5

"I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing.

Yum!",533484,5
"The product is not bad, but must brew at smallest cup size or it has no flavor.  Definitely an aftertaste. Watery.",3294,3

"Don't know if I got a bad batch or old batch, but there is no smoke flavor at all.  At least the salt is relatively tasty, but considering that I could have saved money by just ordering normal Maldon Salt - that is what you should do.",523506,1
"I tried both this flavor and the sea salt flavor, and have to say that this was the better of the two.  These snacks are basically puffed grains mixed with cocoa, and covered with cinnamon and sesame seeds.  I expected to like these.  I love chocolate.  I love chocolate mixed with cinnamon.  That said, these snacks simply weren't all that good, and I'm having a hard time on putting my finger on why I don't like them.  I think perhaps it's that there's too much chocolate.  The good thing about these snacks is that I have no desire to keep eating them- there's no addictive impulse here, so I'll quit eating them once my satisfied.  That's also the bad thing, though, as if I'm going to eat a processed snack food I'd like it to be tastier.<br /><br />As for the claims surrounding this product, I think claims of """"antioxidant power"""" in processed food are always questionable.  I certainly think they're questionable here.  Without the cocoa (which is what supposedly provides the antioxidant power) this would be a pretty good snack.",377015,3
"Great coffee. I love this k-cup flavor. Delicious full bodied coffee for bold coffee lovers, doesn't disappoint. I always buy in bulk, because the price per cup decreases, but also because I KNOW I'm going to drink a lot. Love this coffee!",44285,5

"I'll be honest. Originally, I was looking to buy a different brand name of Kipper Snacks, but it was not available at the time. So by purchasing the Polar Kippers instead, ended up being a better choice for me. In fact my Dad enjoys them as well! They have a great texture and natural smoked flavor that I enjoy eating with Saltine Crackers, or just right out of the can!. I will definitely continue buying these!~ :-)",503640,5

"This is a very neat gift for someone you know that is into cooking and eating.  It has a wide variety of exotic salt represented in the collection.<br /><br />There is a surprising amount of salt in the collection.

"I get a lot of stuff from the Amazon Vine program but this is the first item that I liked so much that I added a subscription to my account for them. Freakin' LOVE these things. My golden retriever is 3 years old. She sees the vet every six months (ongoing medical issue) and each time the vet checks her teeth. She has never had to have a vet cleaning because I'm a bit compulsive about keeping her teeth clean. She normally gets a Greenie a day along with an additive in her water and regular teeth brushing. Yet there always seems to be a bit of tarter build up on her back teeth that I end up scrapping off with a scaler. After chomping down just two of these, that tartar was completely gone. The nice part is that they are much harder for her to chew than the Greenies. Even though I gave her size medium, it still took her several minutes to chew it up. (Greenies are gone within a matter of seconds) And she LOVES them. I'm pretty sure she would save a baby from a blazing inferno if she thought that is what it would take to get one. When she sees me going for the bag, she starts in with doing all the tricks she can think of. Hilarious to watch. They smell...interesting. Like mint and beef jerky? I can't put my finger on the smell exactly. It's not bad or anything. I am now getting a bag of mediums sent each month and will make it a part of her weekly dental hygiene. Very glad to have found these!",446894,5

"At the office I work at I gotta have a fulfilling snack that won't make me put on any more pounds and these Kind Healthy clusters get me most of the way there.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients and nutritional information the clusters certainly have the healthy stuff down with no real adverse ingredients (IE: gluten) that seem to plague just about anything in the grocery store.  It was nice to have a healthier alternative compared to the usual peanuts that I have.<br /><br />The clusters were great with yogurt and milk and that was mostly how I had it.  However, the one time I had the clusters by themselves I wasn't all that impressed as they left a lingering aftertaste and not the good kind either.  Perhaps it was the vanilla but I had to drink some juice to get the annoying taste out of my mouth and they get stuck easily in your teeth.  In short, these clusters are next to no good on their own but are ideal with anything else.<br /><br />A great alternative to munch food but you'll wanna have them in conjunction with something else less you get a weird aftertaste.",182374,4
"I'm a relative newcomer to Keurig coffee, but I do know that I was generally disappointed in the drink produced. However, the Breakfast in Bed K-Cup produces a nicely balanced, not-too-thin cup without being too harsh. I still haven't achieved anything like what I can make either with my french press or with my drip machine, but it's definitely better than the at-work alternative, Community Coffee.",492917,4
"I bought this to try and deal with some unruly neighbor's cats that love to come on my back porch and window battle with my cat.  They have ruined my screen door with their fighting.  I thought I would set this up around the perimeter of the porch to keep them away from the back door and also give my cat some peace of mind.  What the description doesn't tell you is that the fence cannot work unless the animal has contact with the ground and the wire and that it won't conduct through concrete nor can it have any brush in contact with it.  Basically, it has to be on earthen ground with absolutely no plants or anything in its way.  This would have been good to know before buying since my porch is a concrete slab followed by about 2 feet of flower beds which then goes onto common grounds (townhome).  Total waste of time, didn't even begin to set it up since the only place I would have been able to do so would have been in the way of landscapers.  Had to order the product and read the directions to find this out so beware, if you plan to use this in any situation other than a completely clear yard.  Also, only one wire will be electrified and the animal has to be in contact with it and the ground in order to get a the shock so I imagine that a cat would automatically just jump over it.  I guess I'll never be able to test that theory.  Was very disappointed that I had to return it without even giving it a try.",313609,2

"I was excited to try this cereal, and when I eat granola, I like putting them on top of plain (perhaps just slightly sugared) oatmeal cereals. Hot.<br /><br />When I first opened the bag, I was surprised that it smelled a bit rancid... I wasn't sure whether or not that is how it's supposed to smell. However, the taste is great. It is very nutty, and very chewy/crunchy. It also doesn't become soggy quickly, even though I put it into hot oatmeal.<br /><br />My one slight complain would be that the bag does not seem to seal very well. It has the built-in seal, but it doesn't seal tightly - some light movements would open it. It also doesn't stand on its bottom, but that's probably not a huge deal.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this granola. It's very tasty.",321150,4

"Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.",117536,5
"I have tried all of the Italian K-Cups and this is by far the best. Great rich flavor. My only complaint is this brands K-Cups don't always deliver a full 8 or 10 ounces, it seems to either be how Tully prepares their cups or that the tops of some are flattened when they arrive via the mail.",505944,5

The product takes approximately 10 min. to prepare.  The product contains dairy and wheat, and it has been exposed to equipment that also processes egg and soy products.<br /><br />The ingredients include organic whole wheat shell pasta, organic valley organic cheddar cheese (organic cultured pasteurized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), organic whey, salt, and sodium phosphate.<br /><br />This is a mildly flavored whole wheat macaroni & cheese dinner.  This mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food.  The pasta is firm, and it has an excellent flavor.<br /><br />There are no artificial flavors, synthetics colors, or preservatives.  The pasta was produced without antibiotics, synthetic hormones, or persistent pesticides.<br /><br />This pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture.

To add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese, you will have to add your own organic cheese.<br /><br />The cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta.  I give this mac and cheese a 5/5 on packaging, 5/5 for maintain organic integrity, 5/5 on texture, and a 2/5 for flavor.",748,3

I have sent several friends to Amazon to order the plant as they love it when they see mine.  It arrived healthy and has remained healthy over the months.  I originally ordered this plant because I had received two from Red Envelope which arrived quite sickly.  I had ordered them as gifts and had to return them to R.E.

I never thought I'd find something on the store shelves that satisfied us both...and then, in a WalMart in Honesdale PA (where my family owns a vacation home) I saw these.  I trust Newman's Own, so I read the ingredients.  I was happy, and my dog loves them, but I couldn't seem to find them back home in NJ, so I searched Amazon, and here they were.
